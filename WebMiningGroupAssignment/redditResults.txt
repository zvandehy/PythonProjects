SUBMISSION (0): Megathread: Trump adviser Roger Stone guilty on all seven counts of lying to congress, obstruction and witness tampering in relation to the Russia probe

Comment (0): "Roger who?"

Trump in 15 minutes
Comment (1): Roger Stone, a dear friend of Donald Trump, is guilty of federal charges. These can be pardoned.

So... Trump- will you? That’s the real question here.  Stone, I bet,  expects himself to be.

This would be a huge mistake, I'd say.

What a hoax, guys! Another finding of guilty!

Congrats to the jury!  I hope Stone is and remains truly miserable.
Comment (2): #Former Trump Campaign Deputy Campaign Chairman Rick Gates testified last week that President Trump talked to Roger Stone about Wikileaks. This means that President Trump lied to Special Counsel Mueller about never discussing Wikileaks with Roger Stone.^[[1]](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/12/trump-had-call-with-roger-stone-about-wikileaks-rick-gates-says.html)

In the summer of 2016 candidate Trump was directing his advisers to find out about Wikileaks releasing illegally hacked damaging information on the Clinton campaign. At a time when then candidate Trump had been warned by the FBI that Russians and other foreign adversaries would try to interfere with the election. The Trump campaign was asked to alert the FBI of any suspicious overtures made to their campaign.^[[2]](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/fbi-warned-trump-2016-russians-would-try-infiltrate-his-campaign-n830596) Despite the intelligence briefing then candidate Trump continued to deny any wrong-doing by the Russians during the 2016 presidential election.^[[3]](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/trump-again-says-u-s-doesn-t-know-if-russia-n670186)

**According to Special Counsel Mueller Roger Stone was directed by the Trump Campaign to find out about potential future releases;^[[4]](https://www.scribd.com/document/398210081/Stone-Indictment-012419#from_embed)**

*UNITED STATES OF AMERICA v. ROGER JASON STONE, JR.*

>*4.* ROGER JASON STONE, JR. was a political consultant who worked for decades in U.S.  politics and on U.S. political campaigns. STONE was an official on the U.S. presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump (“Trump Campaign”) until in or around August 2015, and maintained regular contact with and publicly supported the Trump Campaign through the 2016 election.
 
>*5.* **During the summer of 2016, STONE spoke to senior Trump Campaign officials about Organization 1 and information it might have had that would be damaging to the Clinton Campaign. STONE was contacted by senior Trump Campaign officials to inquire about future releases by Organization 1.**

>*11.* **By in or around June and July 2016, STONE informed senior Trump Campaign officials that he had information indicating Organization 1 had documents whose release would be damaging to the Clinton Campaign. The head of Organization 1 was located at all relevant times at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, United Kingdom.**

>*12.* **After the July 22, 2016 release of stolen DNC emails by Organization 1, a senior Trump Campaign official was directed to contact STONE about any additional releases and what other damaging information Organization 1 had regarding the Clinton Campaign. STONE thereafter told the Trump Campaign about potential future releases of damaging material by Organization 1.**

>*17.* **On or about October 7, 2016, Organization 1 released the first set of emails stolen from the Clinton Campaign chairman. Shortly after Organization 1’s release, an associate of the high-ranking Trump Campaign official sent a text message to STONE that read “well done.” In subsequent conversations with senior Trump Campaign officials, STONE claimed credit for having correctly predicted the October 7, 2016 release.**

Furthermore, over the course of the Special Counsel's investigation into Russian election hacking the government obtained and executed dozens of search warrants. Several of those search warrants were executed on accounts that contained Stone’s direct communications with Wikileaks and Guccifer 2.0 (Russian intelligence officers);^[[5]](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/5740797/2-15-19-US-Stone-Related-Case.pdf)

>Certain Netyksho defendants, through a fictitious online persona they created, Guccifer 2.0, also interacted directly with Stone concerning other stolen materials posted separately online. 

>...As alleged in the Netyksho indictment, in 2016, the Netyksho defendants stole documents from the DNC, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and the Clinton campaign chairman. Those defendants then released many of the stolen documents, including through a website maintained by Organization 1. In the course of investigating that activity, the government obtained and executed dozens of search warrants on various accounts used to facilitate the transfer of stolen documents for release, as well as to discuss the timing and promotion of their release. **Several of those search warrants were executed on accounts that contained Stone’s communications with Guccifer 2.0 and with Organization 1. Evidence obtained from those search warrants resulted in the allegations that the Netyksho defendants hacked and stole documents for release through intermediaries, including Organization 1, and that Stone lied to a congressional committee investigating, among other things, the activities of Organization 1 regarding those stolen documents.** The relevant search warrants, which are being produced to the defendant in discovery in this case, are discussed further in a sealed addendum to this filing. 

U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson issued a full gag order on Roger Stone.^[[6]](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/roger-stone-apologizes-to-judge-for-instagram-post-my-wife-is-kicking-me) Former Trump Campaign adviser Roger Stone was charged on 7 counts for obstruction, making false statements, and witness tampering.^[[7]](https://www.scribd.com/document/398210081/Stone-Indictment-012419#from_embed)

>**COUNT ONE (Obstruction of Proceeding)**

>*41.* From in or around May 2017 through at least December 2017, within the District of Columbia and elsewhere, the defendant ROGER JASON STONE, JR., corruptly influenced, obstructed, impeded, and endeavored to influence, obstruct, and impede the due and proper exercise of the power of inquiry under which any inquiry and investigation is being had by either House, and any committee of either House and any joint committee of the Congress, to wit: STONE testified falsely and misleadingly at a HPSCI hearing in or around September 2017; STONE failed to turn over and lied about the existence of responsive records to HPSCI’s requests about documents; STONE submitted and caused to be submitted a letter to HPSCI falsely and misleadingly describing communications with Person 2; and STONE attempted to have Person 2 testify falsely before HPSCI or prevent him from testifying.

>All in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1505 and 2.

>**COUNTS TWO THROUGH SIX (False Statements)**

>*43.* On or about September 26, 2017, within the District of Columbia and elsewhere, in a matter within the jurisdiction of the legislative branch of the Government of the United States, the defendant ROGER JASON STONE, JR., knowingly and willfully made and caused to be made materially false, fictitious, and fraudulent statements and representations, to wit:

> - STONE testified falsely that he did not have emails with third parties about the head of Organization 1, and that he did not have any documents, emails, or text messages that refer to the head of Organization 1.

> - STONE testified falsely that his August 2016 references to being in contact with the head of Organization 1 were references to communications with a single “go-between,” “mutual friend,” and “intermediary,” who STONE identified as Person 2.

> - STONE testified falsely that he did not ask the  person he referred to as his “go-between,” “mutual friend,” and “intermediary,” to communicate anything to the head of Organization 1 and did not ask the intermediary to do anything on STONE’s  behalf.

> - STONE testified falsely that he and the person he referred to as his “go-between,” “mutual friend,” and “intermediary” did not communicate via text message or email about Organization 1.

> - STONE testified falsely that he had never discussed his conversations with the person he referred to as his “go-between,” “mutual friend,” and “intermediary” with anyone involved in the Trump Campaign.

>All in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1001(a)(2) and 2.

>**COUNT SEVEN (Witness Tampering)**

>*45.* Between in or around September 2017 and present, within the District of Columbia and elsewhere, the defendant ROGER JASON STONE, JR., knowingly and intentionally corruptly  persuaded and attempted to corruptly persuade another person, to wit: Person 2, with intent to influence, delay, and prevent the testimony of any person in an official proceeding. 

>All in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1512(b)(1).

Comment (3): The most important point [made in the Prosecution's closing arguments](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/us/politics/stones-trial-closing-arguments.html): **Stone lied to protect the Trump campaign**

>“He knew that **if the truth came out about what he was doing in 2016, it would look terrible,”** Jonathan Kravis, an assistant United States attorney, told the jurors on the sixth day of Mr. Stone’s trial on charges of deceiving the House Intelligence Committee two years ago. “Roger Stone knew that if this information came out it would look really bad **for his longtime associate Donald Trump.”**

In paticular, they [made sure to get Rick Gates to testify](https://twitter.com/ShimonPro/status/1194278009747972097) to a specific phone call he witnessed in which Stone told Trump personally what was coming from WikiLeaks:

>"After Mr Trump got off the phone with Mr Stone, **what did Trump say?**"
>
>Gates: **“He indicated more information would be coming."**

Trump was told by Stone as early as July that he was knowledgeable of what WikiLeaks had, knew that they had more hacked content, but for whatever reason the time wasn't right to release it. Then months later...

 - October 7th, 2016 4:00 PM: The [Washington Post reveals the existence](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-recorded-having-extremely-lewd-conversation-about-women-in-2005/2016/10/07/3b9ce776-8cb4-11e6-bf8a-3d26847eeed4_story.html) of the Access Hollywood tape.

 - Less than *one hour* later: WikiLeaks dumps the [hacked Podesta emails](https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/dec/18/john-podesta/its-true-wikileaks-dumped-podesta-emails-hour-afte/), and releases them in dribs and drabs over the following days to maximize saturation.

[Just as Roger Stone had planned](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/01/29/roger-stone-wanted-wikileaks-email-dump-distract-access-hollywood-tape-associate-claims/):

>The striking simultaneity fulfilled the hope of Trump confidant Roger Stone, according to Jerome Corsi, a conservative author and former Stone associate who was subpoenaed over the summer for questioning by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III.
>
>“I had one call from Roger, as I recall it — Roger disputes this — **on the day that WikiLeaks did begin in October dropping the final emails on John Podesta, in which Roger was essentially saying, ‘We’ve got this timing issue because the Billy Bush tape is going to be released, and we’d like to have Assange begin releasing emails now,’”** Corsi told MSNBC’s Ari Melber on Monday. 

The story isn't just that Trump believed he had a backchannel to what was coming from the Russia Intelligence cutout WikiLeaks, it's that his campaign efforted to *coordinate* the release with  to ensure the maximum possible benefit to his 2016 campaign. Mueller did not determine that amounted to statutory criminal conspiracy, but it sure as shit amounts to an effort to collude.

It also shows pretty emphatically that Trump lied in the [Take Home Test that Mueller allowed him to take](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/read-trump-s-written-responses-mueller-report-n995851) in lieu of an interview:

>Response to Question II, Part (g) I spoke by telephone with Roger Stone from time to time during the campaign. I have no recollection of the specifics of any conversations I had with Mr. Stone between June 1, 2016 and November 8, 2016. I do not recall discussing WikiLeaks with him, **nor do I recall being aware of Mr. Stone having discussed WikiLeaks with individuals associated with my campaign**, although I was aware that WikiLeaks was the subject of media reporting and campaign-related discussion at the time.

Indeed, Mueller [acknowledged in his testimony to Congress](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-mueller-answers/mueller-says-he-generally-agrees-trump-was-not-always-truthful-in-written-answers-idUSKCN1UJ2R8) that Trump was "generally" untruthful in his written testimony.
Comment (4): Get fucked Roger.
Comment (5): ~~Get me Roger Stone~~ We got Roger Stone!
Comment (6): Can we please revive the Mueller case now and see the fucking unredacted report finally?
Comment (7): Feels fuckin good man
Comment (8): Lock. Him. Up.
Comment (9): No evidence of Republican criminality except for all of these criminals.
Comment (10): Wow Roger is already losing his mind on  [Twitter ](https://www.twitter.com/rogerjstonejr)
Comment (11): Stone is the sixth associate of Trump to be convicted in the last few years. The list also includes:

   -  Paul Manafort

   -  Michael Flynn

   -  Rick Gates

   - George Papadopoulos

   -  Michael Cohen
Comment (12): He is facing a 50 year sentence, I bet he only get 10. They’ve been so weak on sentencing throughout all of this. They need to make examples of these people.
Comment (13): Trump's campaign chair: felon

Trump's deputy campaign chair: felon

Trump's foreign policy adviser: felon

Trump's national security adviser: felon

Trump's personal lawyer: felon

Trump's longstanding political adviser: felon
Comment (14): Finally. 

Roger stone is finally going to jail. After 50 years of dirty tricks from Nixon all the way through to toady—he’s finally going to jail. 

Hopefully we learn the lesson that we can’t “just move on” like Ford tried to do when he pardoned Nixon for all crimes he may have committed. We should have fucking had this man in prison in 1974. And we can’t just “move on” after trump. Prison awaits all of them.
Comment (15): Trump’s closest circle, ladies and gentlemen: 

**Manafort.** Convicted felon in behavior that directly implicates Trump. 

**Cohen.** Convicted felon in behavior that directly implicates Trump. 

**Flynn.** Convicted felon in behavior that directly implicates Trump. 

**Stone.** Convicted felon in behavior that directly implicates Trump. 

**Giuliani.** Multiple criminal investigations into behavior that directly implicates Trump.
Comment (16): Roger Stone is one of the shittiest people to have ever existed. Deserves to get the rest of his life in prison.  
  
But watch Donnie pardon him.
Comment (17): So turns out lying to members of Congress under oath is a crime after all.

This will bode well for Sondland and all those other Trump sycophants who want to ride his coat tails all the way to jail
Comment (18): **Donald Trump and the No Good, Very Bad, Tremendously Awful Day**

(Trust him, the very worst. A lot of people are saying it)
Comment (19): A republican on CNN just said to trump: "Don't pardon this joker."
Comment (20): GOP is a criminal enterprise. Sorry if that hurts any snowflake conservative feelings but it's objectively fact.
Comment (21): > Stone was convicted Friday. He was charged in a seven-count indictment that alleged he lied to lawmakers about WikiLeaks...

You mean that when he said he had no contact with WikiLeaks, he was actually lying?

You mean he is, in fact, the connection between Trump and WikiLeaks?

You mean Trump was constantly updated, by Stone, about the status of WikiLeaks?
Comment (22): Is today going to be one of those Fridays in which we get a flood of r/JusticeBoner type news
Comment (23): So, doesn't that also mean it is now a Fact Of Law to say Donald John Florida-man lied to Robert Mueller in sworn testimony and therefore committed perjury?

Speaker Pelosi, Chairman Schiff, and the rest of the United States' Congress, if you're listening...
Comment (24): I heard Trump is scheduled to speak today around 2pm.  I wonder if he'll claim that he hardly knew Roger Stone when asked about his being found guilty.
Comment (25): >The evidence showed that in the months leading up to the 2016 election, **Mr. Stone strove to obtain emails that Russia had stolen from Democratic computers and funneled to WikiLeaks**, which released them at strategic moments timed to damage Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent. Mr. Stone **briefed the Trump campaign about whatever he had picked up about WikiLeaks’ plans “every chance he got,”** Jonathan Kravis, a lead prosecutor, said.

Boom roasted
Comment (26): Despite all his rage, he’s now just a rat in a cage
Comment (27): "This is all a witch hunt hoax!"

Weird how all these people keep going to jail for patently illegal shit though. How could these investigations be simultaneously witch hunts but also producing rock-solid indictments and charges? How do you Trump supporters square that circle?
Comment (28): [Mueller, arrest me!](https://youtu.be/lRKzSW_CtuE)

Beautifully aged.
Comment (29): Good.. fuck that guy.
Comment (30): Enjoy prison Ratfucker.
Comment (31): Really bizarre for the extremely not guilty president to have so many of his former campaign members going to jail.
Comment (32): Trump sure does hang out with a lot of criminals, don't ya think?
Comment (33): For those who haven't watched it, the "Get Me Roger Stone" documentary on Netflix is a really great primer on how big an asshole Roger Stone is.
Comment (34): He’s looking at up to 50 years in a federal Penitentiary. I’m sure trump will say he doesn’t know him either lmao.
Comment (35): One thing looks clear: there are more hardened felons in the trump campaign and administration than amongst DACA recipients
Comment (36): Couldn't happen to a better piece of shit
Comment (37): The timing of this verdict of lying to Congress could not have been any better with Sondland about to testify next week.
Comment (38): So Stone is guilty of lying and blah blah blah...

How is Trump not being busted on the same shit? He went along with all of this.
Comment (39): Woohoo, today is a good day for Democracy and the rule of law!
Comment (40): And so begins Roger Stones time in the barrel.
Comment (41): Everything trump touches goes to prison.  I’m sure Ivanka will get locked up some day.
Comment (42): Roger Stone: ["Mr. Cohen's statement is untrue."](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-cohen/ex-lawyer-cohen-assails-conman-trump-gives-no-direct-evidence-of-collusion-idUSKCN1QG0IZ?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reuters%2FtopNews+%28News+%2F+US+%2F+Top+News%29)

Narrator: "That was a lie."
Comment (43): DO Ghoulani NEXT!
Comment (44): Apparently the prosecution asked the judge to send Roger Stone to jail immediately because he violated his gag order. The judge said no though.
Comment (45): Does this mean a new tattoo for Roger's back?
Comment (46): Lol I sure am tired of all this winning
Comment (47): And as history pulls down its pants and prepares to lower ***ITS ASS*** onto Roger Stone’s head, it will be Daddy Justice who will be crapping on him ***THIS TIME***
Comment (48): Stone was just convicted for lying to Congress in order to protect Trump.  Gordon Sondland is about to in the hot seat with pressure to lie for Trump in front of Congress, in sworn testimony.  I wonder if this will factor into how Sondland decides to proceed when he testifies.
Comment (49): They're trying to build a prison

They're trying to build a prison

Another prison system

for Roger Stone to live in
Comment (50): Guilty on all counts. 

Up to 50 years sentence.

Roger Stone will die in jail unless he flips on Trump prior to the sentencing.

<ice_cube-it_was_a_good_day.flac>
Comment (51): All 7 counts GAD DAYUM.
Comment (52): Maximum if 50 years according to the source I just read for all charges. Usually dropped lower for first-time offenders... but the fact that this happened is nothing short of a miracle to me. 

People responsible finally getting held accountable? Is there actually hope???
Comment (53): Victory! Justice! Oh you feel so good. I missed you.
Comment (54): *ahem*

YEAH. BOYYYY.
Comment (55): God this week has been such a breath of fresh air after several acrid years.
Comment (56): 2/3 of these people are felons. All worked for trump. 

https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/manafort-roger-stone-gty-hb-181017_hpMain_4x3_992.jpg
Comment (57): The evidence presented at the trial clearly implicated Trump. If you didn't know better, you'd assume the witnesses and prosecutors were referring to a co-defendant every time they mentioned him. Even IF the DOJ is right about a president's immunity from indictments, once he's out of office there's no reason why Trump shouldn't be arrested and tried for some of the same crimes Stone was just found guilty for.
Comment (58): Friendly reminder that, among other things, evidence from Stone's trial indicate that Trump lied to Mueller in his written testimony, which was provided under oath.

One of the articles of impeachment against *Clinton* was *Perjury*.
Comment (59): Couldn't have happened to a nicer ratfuck.
Comment (60): They got Roger Stone.
Comment (61): I can't wait for trump's tweet slandering the judge and jury.
Comment (62): Fuck Roger Stone.
Comment (63): I gotta say the finale of this season of The Presidency has really picked up steam.
Comment (64): Damn, my no nut november has been officially ruined. Go fuck yourself roger stone. Enjoy jail time.
Comment (65): - Fox News... whelp looks like it’s time for a commercial break!!!
Comment (66): Still waiting on sentencing information. I'm guessing a devastating less than two years of minimum security prison because of his otherwise blameless life, but would be happy to be wrong.
Comment (67): It's absolutely insane to me that this headline will struggle to even break top 5 for today. What a time to be alive.
Comment (68): I hope the judge throws the book at him in sentencing.
Comment (69): All of the "Lock her up" people are going to jail?
Comment (70): foxnews.com: "Stone Sunk" lol
Comment (71): With the Stone trial over, time to declassify a big chunk of the Mueller report ASAP!
Comment (72): So when does the winning stop, for Trump supporters? They must be positively senseless, from all the staggering victories they've experienced.
Comment (73): 9 minutes in, 525 comments.  I'm just here for history.  Glad to see justice prevail.
Comment (74): Trump probably "I barely knew him"
Comment (75): Where are all the apologists? What no "we got him now" pathetic excuses for a joke comments?
Comment (76): Guilty? Really!? Well blow me the guy always seemed like such a straight arrow to me. /s
Comment (77): How does anyone manage to hire people so brutally incompetent and devoid of all morals and principles? Trump's management skills are truly artful.
Comment (78): No "otherwise blameless life" for him
Comment (79): Boy did that attempt at witness intimidation from Trump come at the wrong fucking time.
Comment (80): Now that he has been convicted by a jury...

Lock him up!
Comment (81): How long did the Jury have it? I feel like he was walking into court yesterday, but that might have been Wednesday.

The first few hours of jury deliberations are usually them figuring out how they even come to a resolution, or, alternatively, them say "okay, so this is quite clear, lets wait until after the free lunch though."
Comment (82): This will be a day long remembered.  It has seen the end of Stone, and will soon see the end of the Trump administration.
Comment (83): That shit went from 0 to 50.... years.. very quickly.
Comment (84): There was a line of testimony implying that Trump lied under oath. How does that play out since that testimony was deemed credible enough to convict Stone?
Comment (85): This is a great day for justice. I hope Roger Stone spends the rest of his life in jail.
Comment (86): And what was Stone, *Trump's longest serving political advisor*, convicted of lying **about?**  Being the connection between the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks.
Comment (87): Just a reminder: Roger Stone's problems all stem from efforts to provide cover for trump's ample orange ass.
Comment (88): New Netflix documentary- Got ‘em Roger Stone.
Comment (89): > In one of the trial’s most revealing moments, Rick Gates, Mr. Trump’s deputy campaign chairman, recounted a July 31, 2016, phone call between Mr. Stone and Mr. Trump, just days after WikiLeaks had released a trove of emails embarrassing the Clinton campaign. As soon as he hung up with Mr. Stone, Mr. Gates testified, Mr. Trump declared that “more information” was coming, an apparent reference to future releases from WikiLeaks that would rattle his political rival.
Comment (90): Boosh. All charges. Bah bah bah boosh.
Comment (91): Trump had 4 campaign managers in his life time. 

2 will be in prison, truly the best.
Comment (92): >‘You are a rat. Prepare to die’

Did the jury even deliberate? If so, could you hear their laughter outside the jury room?
Comment (93): Roger that!
Comment (94): Have fun in jail you ratfucker felon.
Comment (95): Get fucked, Roger Stone!
Comment (96): All the President's Men 2 : Electric Boogaloo
Comment (97): Lol get fucked nerd

Comment (100): “So much of this case deals with that question that you need to ask . . . so what?” Stone’s lead attorney Bruce S. Rogow asked.

Classic closing argument. Just doesn't get any more republican than that!
Comment (101): This is wonderful
Comment (102): [Luckily for Roger he didn't spend the entire pre-trial phase pissing off the judge.](https://twitter.com/TheRickWilson/status/1195385271065427969)
Comment (103): Lying to Congress.  That will make some butta pucker up during the impeachment hearings.
Comment (104): SWEET SWEET JUSTICE!

next up: FLYNN (aka: Mr Lock Her Up)
Comment (105): Wow, look at what Stone is saying on Twitter: https://twitter.com/rogerjstone
Comment (106): Couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.
Comment (107): And yet #MAGA & #KAG Will say Mueller Investigation was a waste of tax dollars.
Comment (108): They sure are catching a LOT of witches with these "witch hunts". Stone deserves to rot. He is one of the main reasons that Florida recount was cut short in 2001 and changed the course of this country  forever.
Comment (109): "please pardon me" - Rodger Stone
Comment (110): Get fucked Roger!

Comment (121): This F5 Friday is lit fam!
Comment (122): Welp he's fucked. Maybe he can hope there's a Nixon lover gang in prison he can join.
Comment (123): Is it a coincidence that all people close to trump are found guilty of crimes? Are the apples rotten or is it the tree
Comment (124): Huh, the guy with the Nixon tattoo who I believe actually is a cartoon villain is guilty? Imagine that.
Comment (125): Wonder if he flips.  Doubtful, as he loves being a martyr.
Comment (126): Get fucked, Stone!

Comment (136): Lock them all up.
Comment (137): Even Fox has it on the front page. 

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/roger-stone-found-guilty-in-trial-stemming-from-mueller-probe
Comment (138): We got us another witch, bois!


5 felony counts of lying to investigators, one witness tampering felony, and one obstruction of a congressional probe.


That makes 6 witches found guilty of crimes related to their work for Cadet Bonespurs.
Comment (139): What kind of punishment is he facing?
Comment (140): It's only 9 a.m. here in California, but I'm doing a shot of bourbon to celebrate. WHO'S WITH ME?

Comment (142): And for posterity, let’s check one last time to see Roger Stone’s Twitter tirade![check one last time to see Roger Stone’s Twitter tirade!](Www.twitter.com/rogerjstone)
Comment (143): "Get me Roger Stone!" - Bubba from two cells over
Comment (144): Now flip!
Comment (145): Just a coffee boy
Comment (146): 6 months for an otherwise faultless, perfect existence coming up!
Comment (147): You can see the similarities between what Stone did and what Rudy was doing in Ukraine.

This is all the same play book they were trying to get information from foreign governments and making shit up.

I really hope people can see this...
Comment (148): Remind me again how many people in Obama's inner circle went to jail?
Comment (149): Only took 47 years for this man to goto jail.
Comment (150): That Nixon tattoo is going to stand out in the prison showers!
Comment (151): Sondland take note.
Comment (152): Got me Roger Stone
Comment (153): When keepin it real goes wrong
Comment (154): "I never met Roger Stone. He was a low level coffee boy. Never heard of wikileaks. No collusion, no obstruction."
Comment (155): Did Trump already tweet I don’t know this man or we are still waiting?
Comment (156): How many Trump associates have been found guilty now? Who would have thought winning came with so much illegal activity?
Comment (157): Can the entire Republican party be RICOed already, Jesus Christ.
Comment (158): So Roger Stone got gotten?
Comment (159): Fuck Roger Stone then. Fuck Roger Stone now. Fuck Roger Stone forever.
Comment (160): Good thing he's already down with all the white power gangs.
Comment (161): Off to Russia for Roger.

Comment (167): What kind of incarceration time is he facing?
Comment (168): Ladies and gentleman. We got him!

Down goes Stone! Finally.
Comment (169): Excellent! Anything other than a guilty verdict would be making a mockery of the law.
Comment (170): How many days until Trump issues a full pardon?
Comment (171): Watch “Get Me Roger Stone” on Netflix to see what a scumbag he is. He basically invented the modern right
Comment (172): I think I may actually be able to get through *Get Me Roger Stone* without vomiting now.
Comment (173): This couldn't happen to a nicer asshole. I hope he ends up spending the rest of his life behind bars. He is at the core of the fucked up direction U.S. politics has went over the past few decades, as he was responsible for normalizing the act of directly lying in political ads to the GOP.
Comment (174): Hopefully he spends the rest of his life in prison.
Comment (175): America is lost if you wait for impeachment. The Republicans Senate under McConnell will never remove Trump.

America is lost if you wait for the election results. Republican election interference, backed by Russian efforts, will corrupt the process. Trump won't concede. Vote regardless.

America is lost if you wait for your friends and neighbors to stay protesting before you do. They're waiting for the same thing.

Google a protest and show up to it.

It doesn't matter if it's just you holding a sign on an overpass for an hour.

American citizens cannot continue to be passive witnesses in their own destiny.
Comment (176): Here’s the interview where Julian Assange fails spectacularly in his attempt to cover for Stone.

Comment (188): This is a good day for America.
Comment (189): Stone, after verdict: "Pardon me?"
Comment (190): Good. Hope Trump doesn't pardon him. 

What's the sentencing like for this kind of thing? A year or two at most?
Comment (191): So is this asshole actually going to jail?
Comment (192): Damn this is so hot, I need a cigarette
Comment (193): Ok, but what about the rest of his otherwise blameless life?
Comment (194): Trump is next. On all counts.
Comment (195): Schaden-Friday, my favorite type of Friday.
Comment (196): I'm sure the judge will consider Stone's otherwise blameless life for his sentencing.
Comment (197): That tattoo really paid off
Comment (198): F5 Friday makes it's triumphant return.
Comment (199): While this should be a sticky it should not displace the impeachment hearing sticky

Trump's having a bad day. Good.
Comment (202): No Stone unturned.
Comment (203): Trump was already melting down on Twitter. I wonder how crazy the tweets will get today?
Comment (204): Thoughts and Prayers
Comment (205): Why did a bot get gilded?
Comment (206): Glorious Friday so far
Comment (207): So does that mean he will end up in jail? Or Trump will pardon him?
Comment (208): Does this mean Trump lied to Mueller, and now it is factual record?
Comment (209): Roger Stone is surely disappointed that the jury wasn’t hung.
Comment (210): Lock Him Up!
Comment (211): The man reminds me of Bert from Sesame Street
Comment (212): Queue Presidential Pardon
Comment (213): Trump: this is witness intimidation!
Comment (214): Anyone know when he gets sentenced?

Comment (216): [Stone's going to jail, Stone's going to jail, Stone's going to jail, jail, jail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMhT8mb-0EM)
Comment (217): Assuming he'll just get pardoned?
Comment (218): Ya hate to see it
Comment (219): Thank god. Maybe just maybe, one of these traitors will face justice.
Comment (220): So many witches found in this hunt. What a surprise!

Comment (229): Today is a great day for truth and justice. It is possible!

Comment (232): Here comes the pardon
Comment (233): Bye bye shitstain.
Comment (234): It's the cover up that always gets them. Sweet.
Comment (235): Get fucked, Stone.
Comment (236): We’re gonna have the best people, I assure you. The very best.
Comment (237): Trump hardly knew the guy!
Comment (238): Hello future historians!
Comment (239): One of the few times I'm happy to see my entire screen in 'new' filled with the same headline.
Comment (240): The rat fucker gets rat fucked.
Comment (241): He was asking for it.
Comment (242): Get me Roger Stone.. To prison!
Comment (243): Lock. Him. Up.
Comment (244): Dance party!
http://gph.is/1sCBTu1
Comment (245): "Something something these are just boring process crimes..."

- Republicans, probably
Comment (246): This was long overdue.
Comment (247): Does Trump barely know him yet?
Comment (248): Thoughts and prayers
Comment (249): I love how in denial Trump supporters are.

He and all his co-conspirators **will** crash and burn, but they cant understand that.
Comment (250): Oh man, I am fucking mainlining schadenfreude today.
Comment (251): Roger will die in prison, that traitorous fuck!
Comment (252): Who Framed Roger Ratfucker?

No one. He guilty.
Comment (253): Get Me Roger Stone Part Two: I'm Sorry He Can't Help, He's In Jail.
Comment (254): Looks like Trump is between a Stone and a hard place.
Comment (255): Thoughts and prayers
Comment (256): Roger Stone: ["Mr. Cohen's statement is untrue."](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-cohen/ex-lawyer-cohen-assails-conman-trump-gives-no-direct-evidence-of-collusion-idUSKCN1QG0IZ?feedType=RSS&feedName=topNews&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reuters%2FtopNews+%28News+%2F+US+%2F+Top+News%29)

Narrator: "That was a lie."
Comment (257): The best people
Comment (258): Nice
Comment (259): I'm starting to lose count of how many people in Trumps orbit is/was/will be in jail. How many more to go. Vegas has to be taking bets on this.
Comment (260): Maybe he should have become president so he could argue that he’s allowed to obstruct, witness tamper, and lie under oath.
Comment (261): Very legal and very cool
Comment (262): Poor little roger stone, I pray that he gets a thimble full of justice after a life creating an ocean of shit.
Comment (263): I wonder how the Q people are going to square this with "Patriots are in control".
Comment (264): Can he be pardoned for this?  I really want his ass to sit in jail, but I 100% believe Trump will pardon him given the opportunity.
Comment (265): Discussion of potential presidential pardon incoming
Comment (266): This is good. Keep showing how everyone around Trump broke laws and covered up. Then when the smoke clears it's obvious Trump did the same stuff
Comment (267): Bye bye
Comment (268): Adios, RATFUCKER!
Comment (269): Well...bye.
Comment (270): Roger Stone is another one of those people who could very likely commit suicide in prison when the cameras are malfunctioning and he managed to snap his own neck.
Comment (271): F5 Friday just keeps getting better
Comment (272): Fuck yeah. Lower level weasel gets his due. Took too damn long.

Comment (281): Anybody see that documentary "Get F***** Roger Stone"
Comment (282): That was quick.

I imagined that circus was going to keep on going and going.
Comment (283): And if Trump wasn’t occupying the Presidency he’d be awaiting his conviction at trial too.
Comment (284): ALL 7 counts. Give the ratfucker the maximum sentence too, Judge Jackson. The witness tampering alone is at least 20 years.

Lol roger, I can't think of anyone more deserving.
Comment (285): Stone has practically begging Trump for a pardon.  I'm actually a mixed bag, as I would hate to see Stone go through, but the backlash of such an action would be impressive to behold.
Comment (286): He's just a disgusting, nasty man.
Comment (287): [huehuehuehue](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/63/49/05/6349054b1e022051414b26fd99e49273.jpg)
Comment (288): Over/under on a pardon?

Hopefully that goon rots in jail for the rest of their life.
Comment (289): You know dudes in prison are gonna aim for that Nixon tattoo
Comment (290): You know, he just may thrive in jail. He’ll be with his own kind.
Comment (291): Couldn't have happened to a shittier human being.
Comment (292): You hate to see it happen; couldn't have happened to a better person. /s
Comment (293): For once, I'm glad Christmas has come early!
Comment (294): You love to see it.
Comment (295): Accountability is a good thing.
Comment (296): Republicans: "How *dare* Schiff reveal in real time that President Trump is engaging in witness intimidation! That's the *real* issue here!
Comment (297): Fuck this whole administration
Comment (298): It’s a good start, now let’s get the others
Comment (299): Fellow prisoners will get to use his Nixon tattoo as a cum shot target.

Today is a good day!
Comment (300): Bah, apparently Stone is to be released on conditions? Had hoped he'd get to stew in custody until sentencing in February.

EDIT: Gag order still in effect apparently, but she hasn't seemed to really do much about his violations of that before.
Comment (301): Roses are red  
Steel bars are grey  
Now Roger wears orange  
And will take it up the A
Comment (302): Maybe you can try some *actual* ratfucking in prison biotch.
Comment (303): Prison inmates be like "Get Me Roger Stone's Butthole".
Comment (304): Good. Another small win for justice.
Comment (305): So satisfying to finally hear!

Comment (315): This is a good day
Comment (316): "ha ha"
Comment (317): Today is a great day!
Comment (318): Justice prevails for now. Lock him up.
Comment (319): Prison for Slimeball Stone. That just sounds right.
Comment (320): is the pardon on the way?
Comment (321): Has he been sentenced?
Comment (322): Rek’d
Comment (323): The rat fucker just got fucked.
Comment (324): [deleted]
Comment (325): Justice!
Comment (326): Over/under on long it takes Trump to claim he barely knows him?
Comment (327): Not a good day for Trump and his followers. Hopefully this is just the start of the justice we will see in the near future.
Comment (328): Good.  Now I hope they sentence the hell out of him.
Comment (329): Roger Stone is a puss
Comment (330): Even when Trump pardons him, he can't remove all of the public testimony that has surfaced Trump's incidents of perjury and corruption.
Comment (331): Would he be offered a cooperation agreement prior to sentencing if he's willing to flip? Or does that not apply now that there's a conviction?
Comment (332): Got You Roger Stone
Comment (333): Uh oh
SUBMISSION (1): Discussion Thread: Day Two of House Public Impeachment Hearings | Marie Yovanovitch - Live 9am EST

Comment (0): Jim Jordan is a piece of shit 


Change my mind
Comment (1): Roger Stone just gave Sondland a glimpse of what's to come if he doesn't get his fucking act together and tell Congress what he knows.
Comment (2): Trump tweets attacks/threats in live time as Yovanovitch is testifying how intimidated she feels by his actions. Simultaneously Stone is convicted on 7 counts, including witness tampering. Historic to the nth degree.
Comment (3): Roger Stone found guilty of Perjury among other things.

Good day so far.
Comment (4): Fuck Gym Jordan
Comment (5): "this woman has turned an ambassadorship earning 200k a year for 32 years into *6 million dollars*!"

yes that is how math works
Comment (6): In today's hearings: Adam Schiff quotes George Kent's "pissing off the corrupt" and allows the witness being called, Marie, to respond to negative Trump tweets in real time. Meanwhile, Roger Stone is found guilty on all 7 counts which includes lying to Congress in an effort to protect Trump.

What. A. Day.
Comment (7): The Republican callers on C-SPAN are quite something. Something truly insane, that is.
Comment (8): You guys, this day has so much pizazz
Comment (9): Roger Stone down, now let’s get back to bringing trump down.
Comment (10): Me from last thread:

Call your representative now. 

This criminal administration cannot stand. If you are in a Democratic district, let them know you support articles of Impeachment. 

If you are in a Republican district, tell them it's disgusting and make them go on record saying it is okay to intimidate witnesses. And add to that how many people in Trump's orbit have gone to prison. 

www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative
Comment (11): The guy who has to listen to callers on CSPAN is not only incredibly patient, but also probably could have a future in the World Series of Poker with that straight faced response to all manner of madness.
Comment (12): Roger Stone being found Guilty on all 7 counts, one of which being witness intimidation, within an hour of Trump intimidating a witness on twitter, is just....I mean, at least we’re getting some *pizzazz*
Comment (13): Fuck Jim Jordan.
Comment (14): Fuck Donald Trump
Comment (15): Yet another republican conspiracy theorist plugging his own youtube channel lmao
Comment (16): Q saves the world! LMFAO
Comment (17): The presenter on C-Span has the patience of a saint
Comment (18): Now we have "deep state" accusations from c span callers.  
Pathetic mental gymnastics.
Comment (19): Anyone here that caller on C-Span? He went all Q anon and Deep state.
Comment (20): "I'm a Democrat, but I think the ambassador is the deep state and Trump has exposed her corruption"
Comment (21): Will Gym return with a jacket? Stay tuned...
Comment (22): Is this thread 2?
Comment (23): Fuck Gym Jordan
Comment (24): derp stert
Comment (25): Fuck that guy. Lol Democrat line talking about the fucking deep state and plugging his YouTube channnel
Comment (26): I can't listen to the callers on cspan anymore
Comment (27): Caller talks about Deep State and plugs his top mind youtube channel for more info. Pretty much your average Trump voter.
Comment (28): Best moment so far:  Trump being called out on real time witness intimidation.

Worst moment so far:  CSPAN Callers.
Comment (29): "You're breaking up.  Not your cellphone signal, just you."
Comment (30): Oh hey, a wild Qultist called in. It's hard to say whether he was complimenting the ambassador for wise money management, or trying to imply that being rich and in politics means that you are corrupt (but not Trump, because no reasons).
Comment (31): Young me: recess should never end

Today me: i want this recess to be over!  I WAS PROMISED TESTIMONY dammit!
Comment (32): I can't believe that we had a President livetweeting about his own impeachment hearing...and the committee was using those tweets *during the hearing as evidence*. We live in a surreal time.
Comment (33): "Trump didn't intimidate the witness, Schiff did by reading the tweet!"

C-SPAN caller
Comment (34): fuck nunes
Comment (35): So reportedly, the Republicans were planning on not attacking the diplomat, since she's be too credible, and instead focus on how she doesn't really know anything of substance.

Are they now gonna attack her? Because this strategy probably doesn't work. Will be interesting to see whether Trump's tweet managed to change the minority's strategy in this hearing.
Comment (36): Get off the sauce, lady
Comment (37): I'm 33, never voted before and listened to NPR all through the last election on my way home from work, thought this guy could never get voted in he's such an idiot! Now I'm going to be registering to vote democrat.
Comment (38): This thread is moving so fast nobody will notice I’m gay
Comment (39): Oh no, not the deep state! /s
Comment (40): Republicans calling in on the "Democrats' line" on CSPAN... sorry, but your opinion is no less bullshit when presented this way.
Comment (41): >"Stone   himself explained his philosophy in a clip from his House testimony   played for jurors. Quoting the writer Gore Vidal, he said, “Never pass   up an opportunity to have sex or appear on television.”  
>  
>Not one juror smiled.

Way to go weirdo Roger.
Comment (42): I'm switching to PBS. I can't take the CSPAN callers anymore.
Comment (43): Bets on if Roger Stone escapes to Russia before sentencing
Comment (44): Enjoy pound-you-in-the-ass prison Roger Stone.
Comment (45): Lmao errybody get in here
Comment (46): Thread 2, baby. Let's see if we can hit 3 again
Comment (47): Fuck Gym Jordan
Comment (48): >If you want more inf...

That's when C-SPAN should hang up.
Comment (49): LMAO america is fucked. what a joke
Comment (50): Deep state mention. Drink up, ya drunkees
Comment (51): What's up with the YouTube channel plugs?
Comment (52): This is going to be a rough call guys.
Comment (53): Angry and emotional people are the loudest. Republicans seem to be the ones being the loudest right now.
Comment (54): For those of us excited to witness history unfold in real time, today is pretty fucking epic. 

* dramatic witness testimony from Yovanavich
* a presidential\* tweet read live in a congressional hearing that clearly attempts to intimidate the witness
* Roger Stone found guilty in the morning with another witness suspected of lying to Congress yet to testify in the afternoon. 

What a fucking day. I'll never forget "where I was when..."
Comment (55): Just opened it up, is it over?
Comment (56): Lol deep state
Comment (57): hello friends.
Comment (58): Did anyone hear the latest CSPAN call? Or was that just a fever dream?
Comment (59): Roger Stone sentencing will take place on Thursday, February 6th at 10am.
Comment (60): Stone will get to swing with a lot of men in prison.  He won't even have to place ads in swinger magazines.
Comment (61): Bad day for Russia
Comment (62): We’re about to get some crazy tweets where trump mixes up stone and yovanovitch.
Comment (63): Wtf is wrong with these peoples phones.  sounds like a transatlantic call from seventy years ago.
Comment (64): I'm still not over the whole insane Nunes "Dems wanted noodz of our Dear Leader!" thing.  Like, seriously.
Comment (65): The live tweetness intimidation though. Best thing I've seen in years!
Comment (66): It is clear some Republicans are calling into the Democrat number saying some bullshit like: "even me as a democrat (Insert GOP talking point)."
Comment (67): Deep state on Dem line C-span screen your callers
Comment (68): this lady sounds like she's calling from the inside of her own colon
Comment (69): This whole thing would be funny if it wasn’t so real.
Comment (70): Not the Deep State!
Comment (71): Omg the crime was withholding the aid for personal gain. Jsbshsjsbs

Comment (80): Any idea on what they are voting on?
Comment (81): Just tuning in. Anything particularly important happen?

Comment (87): How long is this recess?
Comment (88): Should probably get a better phone.
Comment (89): Poor Donnie..all his friends going to jail.
Comment (90): Its alarming hearing the callers. Some sound like they are obviously paid to ask certain types of questions, while others are so idiotic and ignorant that im left puzzled with perhaps a meteor should really just wipe us all out if that level of stupidity is the byproduct of humanity.
Comment (91): Roger Stone is going to Epstein himself. Watch.
Comment (92): Follow up documentary: Got Me Roger Stone
Comment (93): On March 27, 2031 my daughter will be 12 years old and starting to really get into learning about the history of America.

I'm living through this shit it real time and have no idea how I'm going to even begin to convince her that this all did in fact happen. Hell, I can't even believe the things that have happened/are currently happening/will happen.

Comment (100): Based student caller
Comment (101): Been away at work for 2 hours, what did I miss?
Comment (102): Hahahah this caller just made the argument that Schiff intimidated the witness by reading Trumps tweet. Haha wtf
Comment (103): *Trumps tweet trashing Yovanovitch is also a move to intimidate others who have not testified yet. Mid-career people like David Holmes are the targets.* ~ Michael McFaul (Former Ambassador to Russia that Trump wanted to turn over to Putin for interrogation in Helsinki disaster)

https://twitter.com/McFaul/status/1195381722944196608
Comment (104): Another student calling into C-Span. Yay!
Comment (105): These people are so lost

Comment (111): Marie is really a solid witness!  How does it end? Is she really a double agent? Is she having an affair with a Trump son? or daughter? This series is great!

Comment (1): Resign? Being a White Nationalist is why he was hired.  He's not leaving and he's not going to be removed, either

The current administration IS the swamp
Comment (2): If they are all Democrats, the headline is pointless. Republicans can be as corrupt as they want and will never resign. Their party condones it.
Comment (3): And of course, crickets from the GOP. And why would they say anything, if Stephen Miller is the culmination and desired result of their rhethoric and agenda? Again and again, at every opportunity, the Republican Party becomes the home of white nationalism, and shame on us as a nation if we ever forget it.
Comment (4): The GOP is a corrupt hate group and needs to be completely taken down.
Comment (5): Stephen Miller must be removed, however that being said, it will also verify that he is merely only the embodiment and scapegoat for the true, deep-seeded racism long held within trump's black heart.  Miller's power within the administration is the symptom of a diseased mind.
Comment (6): [Y'all remember that time he spray painted his head to go on TV?](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/12/17/18144716/stephen-miller-spray-hair-loss-toppik-glh)
Comment (7): How is it, one person had to resign because she had sex with a staffer (and by all reports, it was consensual), and another person is totally fine after being a proven racist and actually pushing that racist agenda to the levels of national policy?

What is happening?!
Comment (8): Out of 435 total.  Not even a quarter of the US representatives will stand up to tell an open white supremacist to GTFO of the White House.
Comment (9): Trump has an anti-American world view. This is why Miller got the job.  
The emails merely confirm the underlying basis of Trump's policies
Comment (10): An international war crimes tribunal seems in order, is the Hague busy these days?
Comment (11): LOL make me, race traitors!
 
 - Stephen "Bring Me The Blood Of Babies That I May Feast Upon It" Miller
Comment (12): *[Stephen Miller sheds his skin in concern]*
Comment (13): How do Don and his gang of goons become more loathesome each day? Fuck all GOP y'all.
Comment (14): White supremacy is a feature for this administration, not a bug.
Comment (15): Small question:   


What is the number of white nationalists/supremacists that Trump has either had in his administration + his 2016 campaign team + folks he's heaped praise upon as he helped their own election campaigns.   


I ask 'cause folks keep claiming that the President isn't actually a white nationalist, but I suspect that I'm seeing a pattern of association on his part.
Comment (16): Is that the creepy far right guy?

&#x200B;

I find it funny in a way - people say the Tories in the UK are far right( (really their note). But it seems the far right in America is like the nut job crazies that never make it over in the UK..

&#x200B;

You're dems are like our right wing.
Comment (17): Trump will defend SM with "He's a great guy, a tough guy, we get along very well."
Comment (18): Why would Goebbles resign?
Comment (19): Disgusting right-wing nutjob. Almost as disgusting is Stephanie Grisham's defense of this racist right winger and attacks of the highly respected SPLC
Comment (20): Why doesn't the President fire him? If I found out one of my employees was a practicing white supremacist I would fire him/her without thinking twice about it.
Comment (21): In the constant rotation of scandals this should be headline Presidency Damaging news. 

But no, this is a Friday and par for course in the Trump administration. 

He references "The Camp of the Saints" which is a blatantly racist and anti-immigrant book where the "hero" of the story murders immigrants. He is currently sitting as the mastermind of Americans immigration policy. 

Trump may be a stupid monster, but Stephen Miller is an actual monster. His intentions are concise and clear. 

I'll add this. Trump supporters seem to get all bent out of shape when we call them racist and after things like this come out they dont bat an eye. It is reasonable to assume a Trump supporter may be a racist if they continue to support Trump after Charlottesville, the border human rights abuses, and Stephen Miller.
Comment (22): Our parents/grandparents/great grandparents fought to protect this country from Nazis. Now they’ve taken over. This is what happens when hatred wins. My grandfather was willing to put his life on the line for this country. Are these malignant sycophants willing to do the same for Trump? No. They’re all a bunch of racist pussies.
Comment (23): Stephen Millers racism isn’t a glitch, it’s a feature.
Comment (24): If the firing of Steve Bannon taught us anything, the best way to get Trump to fire Miller is for people to start saying President Miller.
Comment (25): Umm.. it took this long for them to figure it out? He's the architect to all the new immigration policies including separation of family. And if anyone was semi interested, you can read that Steve Miller has been an outright white nationalist since his HS years. Funny how he was raised by immigrants but became a white nationalist.
Comment (26): He is Trump’s Goebbels. He even resembles him
Comment (27): Pisses me off that this isn't a unanimous resolution from the dems. Fight white supremacy or gtfo
Comment (28): Trump supporters: *"Our presidnet isn't a racist!"*

*Trump doesn't fire an obviously racist subordinate*

Trump supporters: *Our president isn't a racist!!!"*
Comment (29): The defining feature of the Republican Party appears to have become White Nationalism.    When one of them mentions "conservative values", this is what should immediately come to mind.
Comment (30): Headline is incorrect, let me fix it for you - "White Nationalist in White House: 86% of Congress Okay With That"
Comment (31): Of course no Republicans. Because support of Donald Trump is more important that the integrity of our government. 

Can’t wait till some dumbass conservative comes in with a bullshit “whataboutism”. Here’s a preemptive “fuck you.”
Comment (32): Unfortunately standing up to white supremacy appears to be a partisan issue.

Comment (33): If we are getting rid of the White Nationalists, Trump should be going with him.
Comment (34): They have to ask him to resign because even though Trump fires people regularly, he’d never do it because the person is a fucking white supremacist.
Comment (35): They are all democrats....so the fuck what...this is meaningless. Have a republican on there and it might mean something
Comment (36): Resign the racist president hasn't fired him y....

Yea he ain't going any where.
Comment (37): Stephen Miller is America’s  Eichmann and Joseph Goebbells
Comment (38): He won't, and Trump certainly isn't going to fire his Secretary of Ethno-State.  He needs all the distractions he can get right now.
Comment (39): yah, spray hair goebbels will never resign
Comment (40): Wow, what a time to be alive, 17% of the house of representatives is hard on white nationalism. Really inspiring message. You guys are definitely going to get on post-irony Goebbels with this one.
Comment (41): Stay. Keep reminding everyone to vote blue.
Comment (42): This guys got to be the creepiest motherfucker I’ve ever seen
Comment (43): Headline should read “only 76 democrat members of Congress...”
Comment (44): Do y’all remember when stuff like an affair could just tank your whole political career? People would resign over bad optics.
Comment (45): And zero Republicans joking the call?

Sorry, zero White Nationalists
Comment (46): What it should really say is: "Only about 75 of congress 535 members wanted a white nationalist to resign"
Comment (47): Only 75 member denounced a (semi) closeted white nationalist employed by the Whitehouse. We’re in deep shit America.
Comment (48): Nothing new for Miller. They had a petition against him in day care.
Comment (49): donald j trump is the grand wizard of the kkk morons...
Comment (50): Of course, zero are Republicans.
Comment (51): Zero republicans.  until that number changes, nothing will change.
Comment (52): That racist piece of shit needs to go. A filthy worm feeding off the corpse of American democracy.
Comment (53): Only 75? And only Democrats?
America is disgusting.
Comment (54): He looks like a serial killer.
Comment (55): only 75 out of  435 members of Congress called him out.  WTF
Comment (56): Funny how we have all these racist white nationalist white power etc groups yet im still dirt fucking poor. Im starting to think there is more  to their elitism than just color. I mean, fuck them regardless but lol 99.9% of us white guys get jackshit from these wastes of space
Comment (57): That guy creeps me the fuck out
Comment (58): One can pray for a brain aneurysm right?
Comment (59): Yes please lil Nosferatu, resign for the sake of all that is still good in this world. Go be a blood-sucker elsewhere.
Comment (60): The fact that it's only 75 is pathetic.
Comment (61): 75 Democrat Members of Congress...

There, I fixed it.
Comment (62): Why is it only 75?
Comment (63): Stephen Miller to 75 members of Congress: *angry chittering noises like a rabid squirrel protecting its winter nut stash*
Comment (64): Guys, it's a nice thought, and the right thought, but you need to understand; you don't live in a democracy right now. It's a cult of personality. All of Congress could be against him. He's not going anywhere unless Trump says so. He lives off of the divisions of others.
Comment (65): Anyone else remember when like 100 different people called for kellyanne conway to resign for violating the hatch act? She went to sleep that night just fine. If you are STILL in the trump white house at this point, you are the lowest of the low. The most racist, xenophobic, hateful, ignorant and anti-democratic people left. I would love it if we could convince people to step down, but i dont think its remotely possible. Miller is fine, hes gonna back to sucking blood from immigrants or whatever he does.
Comment (66): Until now I always wondered how hitler and the nazis came to power. Now I’m thinking ah so that’s how it happens.
Comment (67): 75 million Americans would like him to resign life, but I doubt that'll happen either
Comment (68): resign from life.
Comment (69): Stephen Miller was hired to do what he does. It wasn’t even secret, he just didn’t publish his emails. Nothing will happen. Overt media-coordinated white supremacy in government will be just one more thing normalized under the Trump administration.
Comment (70): We used to hunt Nazis as criminals and exact extreme prejudice against them
Comment (71): They should read a single Miller email per day on the Senate floor. Make the news cover them individually. I’m not suggesting this will result in his removal, but there’s enough horrible stuff in there to last until Nov 2020.
Comment (72): Journalists, start calling him President Miller and run stories about how he manipulates Trump. It worked on Bannon.
Comment (73): How come “master race” people always look like fuckin’ weasels?
Comment (74): 75 members of Congress and not one a republican, that in and of itself speaks volumes. The 2020 election is becoming the most important election in our history. I strongly urge EVERYONE to get out and vote, to get these obviously racist republicans the hell out of our government.
Comment (75): You have to hand it to Trump, he is Making America Great Again. Back when America was great, one could be openly racist, and still get elected/appointed to government. 

Back when Joe Biden could "[disagree](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-48696126)" with racists senators, but work with them and surely that didn't impact legislation like the Crime Bill. 

Ah, the good old days when America was great for white men. 

:/
Comment (76): White nationalists have no place in politics, let alone this world
Comment (77): So many nihilists in this thread.  Fuck this un-American  piece of shit, he needs to go IMMEDIATELY.
Comment (78): There are 535 members of Congress. 75 is 14%. How is that number so low?
Comment (79): There is some much hate in his eyes.
Comment (80): are ANY of them republicans?
Comment (81): 75 members of congress and $5 will get you a cup of coffee. All Democrats, and not even most of them. 

That said, I don't see how they wouldn't at least be able to pass an official resolution condemning Miller's behavior. I wouldn't want to be caught dead voting against it even as a Republican, it was pretty bad.
Comment (82): That is one disturbed little weasel glare face.
Comment (83): *hairline intensifies*
Comment (84): Lol resign. He’ll only resign if he’s put in jail. Unfortunately, being a huge douche isn’t illegal
Comment (85): He really reminds me of the Yellow Bastard sometimes.
Comment (86): "No."-Stephen Miller
Comment (87): That’s it? Only 75? There should be universal condemnation of this POS
Comment (88): My Democratic congressman isnt on the list. I think I'll contact him today and ask why not.
Comment (89): How is it only 75?
Comment (90): You see how there is not one Moral Republican in that list... now tell me how there isn't a Racist Republican Agenda...
Comment (91): He truly looks like he could play a villain in John Wick 4.
Comment (92): I just want to express my appreciation for not using the headline we have come to expect here - "75 Democrats in Congress: Resign..."
Comment (93): Why are only 75 members telling him to resign?
Comment (94): That's like...a really low number. significantly lower than I'd hoped
Comment (95): Zero GOP members I presume
Comment (96): Only 75?
Comment (97): Only 75? That’s a number far too low.
Comment (98): He won’t leave because him and Kushner OWN Trump. They have him by the balls and he knows it.
Comment (99): How many democrats are in congress?
Comment (100): We Muslims have been raising alarms about Islamphoboes like Miller for years. Nobody listened but thankfully people are taking notice now. Stephen Miller, Peter King, Donald Trump are islamphobes and that makes them racist, white nationalists, xenophobes, antisemitic, and certainly immoral and unethical. You can't be an Islamophobic without being evil to your core.
Comment (101): There's a White House director of social media?  What do they do -- charge Trump's phone?
Comment (102): A Republican resign JUST for being racist...never gonna happen.  I am pretty sure you can't even get membership in the Republican party without ticking yes in the "Are you a racist?" box on their application.
Comment (103): A Jewish White Nationalist?
Comment (104): Stephen Miller: no.

When are we going to stop pretending that Republicans even have the capacity to do the right thing?  We're kidding ourselves if we think they'll go quietly.
Comment (105): why does he look like a bald joe gatto
Comment (106): All are Dems so he won't go anywhere
Comment (107): The real story is why is it not 435...
Comment (108): I’m pretty sure that Trump picked Miller as his advisor precisely because he’s a white nationalist. Also, the fact that there’s still some Congressional members who are okay with Stephen Miller is part of the problems we have today.
Comment (109): That number feels... low?
Comment (110): This deserves a spot on www.therepublicanpartyhasbetrayedamerica.com
Comment (111): Wonder how many of those 75 have an R after their name?
Comment (112): the American JOseph GOebbels
Comment (113): Only 75?
Comment (114): That Miller is still employed speaks volumes about how far down the Trump rabbithole we collectively are. Pick any President from Ford to Obama (and more than a few before Ford); any single one of those guys would have already terminated Miller for a scandal like this. 

Firing Miller or forcing him to resign should really be a "both sides" issue. Instead we have a White House staffer saying that publishing the white nationalist emails that Miller himself wrote is an anti-semitic attack on Miller. The mental fuckery that it takes to even utter those words is staggering.
Comment (115): In real life, a job would fire you, not ask for your resignation.
Comment (116): offs.  Enough with this shit.  Certify Trump as incapable of performing the duties of the office.  He can barely complete a coherent sentence.  GOP Senators and McTurtle are holding up the process.  Be prepared to change our democracy cause this insanity ain't working when we have extreme issues at hand.

Edit:  Getting rid of Trump gets rid of the lot of this human filth.
Comment (117): Trump will just promote him now.
Comment (118): OUt of those 75, guess how many were Rs?
Comment (119): You'd think they think he has a sense of shame or responsibility or something. 

Scum never leave office voluntarily. They leave when they're kicked, and then they do it kicking and screaming.
Comment (120): Republicans = *crickets*
Comment (121): I don't like Miller or Trump.  I believe both should be removed from government.  

What i don't understand is this controversy.  What makes him a white nationalist in these emails?  I read one SLPC articles and came away scratching my head.  Unless the definition of white nationalist has been watered down significantly to include people who are anti immigration.
Comment (122): Only 75?!
Comment (123): Only 75?  Disgraceful!
Comment (124): only 75? wtf
Comment (125): Where can I find just the emails?
Comment (126): "Over 75"?


Why not just say 76?
Comment (127): They need to throw him to the wolves
Comment (128): Stephen Miller: "OMG ANTI-SEMITISM WHY DO YOU HATE MY PEOPLE SO MUCH JUST FOR WHO WE WERE BORN AS"

Even if that *were* true, it would be r/selfawarewolves
Comment (129): Only?
Comment (130): Here's his uncle David S. Glossers [article](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/08/13/stephen-miller-is-an-immigration-hypocrite-i-know-because-im-his-uncle-219351) on him. Everybody knew, especially his family.
Comment (131): Americans, please please please vote 

I know there’s still going it be cheating, gerrymandering and other GOP dirty tactics, but something needs to change ffs. This can’t keep happening.
Comment (132): Has he ever posed for a photo and not looked like he was about to shut down an orphanage?
Comment (133): Bannon was and probably still is also an extremely dangerous piece of shit white nationalist. he seems to have gotten a pass. which pisses me off.
Comment (134): Only 75? That's disappointing.
Comment (135): Stephen Miller is "our Goebbels".
Comment (136): So disgusting. Throw the whole lot in the trash.
Comment (137): Miller is a Jewish Kapo implementing his Nazi Agenda !
Comment (138): And in the end, the Nazi's win..
Comment (139): Oh, look.  Not a single goddamned Republican on that list.  And they say the Democrats are the party of "Identity Politics".
Comment (140): The only Fox News article on this is about AOC “slamming” Miller for alleged white nationalist ties. Republicans won’t disavow him, and they’re doing their best to prevent constituents from knowing.
Comment (141): Shaming politicians in general or people in the Trump doesn’t work. Times changed when Trump got elected after admitting to sexual assaulting women.
Comment (142): Not gonna happen. White House likes white supremacy.
Comment (143): That jaggoff won’t resign, he takes that as a “mission accomplished”
Comment (144): The Crypt Keeper ain't going nowhere.

These are fucked up, dark times in our history as a nation.
Comment (145): Trump filled the swamp with pieces of shit.
Comment (146): Roger Stone found guilty. It’s gearing up
to be a Good Friday!
Comment (147): Trump supporters: "We dont see what the problem is?"

*shockedpika.jpg*
Comment (148): The guy is a full blown Neo-Nazi and even his family hates him
Comment (149): He's an R, of course he won't leave and none from his party will ask him to.

Al Franken was a D though and he took a picture as a joke in poor taste so of course he had to leave.

When will Americans stop tolerating the different standards for the parties?
Comment (150): Being that baby boomers support this president (and his machine) so overwhelmingly, do they realize Nazi ideology entails killing off the handicapped and the OLD people?
Comment (151): Trump is too stupid to fire him.
Comment (152): But he won't because he completes Agolf Twittler.
Comment (153): > Over 75 Members Of Congress To Stephen Miller: Resign From White House Now

Stephen Miller: Nah, dog, it's why I'm here.
Comment (154): The white supremacy is why he was hired.
SUBMISSION (3): Asking Supreme Court to Shield His Tax Returns, Trump Claims He Is 'Absolutely Immune' From Criminal Investigation; "It's absolutely shocking the lengths Donald Trump will go to to shield himself from accountability."

Comment (1): > President Donald Trump late Thursday asked the right-wing Supreme Court to block the Manhattan district attorney's subpoena for his tax returns, arguing that he is "absolutely immune from all stages of state criminal process while in office."

If this is the argument, than they should have no problem giving it to congress for oversight in a non criminal inquiry - which they are trying to block, also.
Comment (2): Roberts would be wise not to take up this case. No president has ever pushed things this far so fast.
Comment (3): How is the review of tax documents a criminal process?  It may lead to a criminal process...especially if there are irregularities, but, Article 2 of the Constitution doesn’t protect trump from crimes he may have committed prior to being elected.  So, the point is moot.  Release the taxes, and then fight whatever battle there inevitably will be.

SCOTUS better not take this up...
Comment (4): It's like every time he mentions his tax returns, he's saying "the evidence of my crimes is in the tax returns. IT'S IN THE TAX RETURNS. THE TAX RETURNS! LOOK THERE!!!"
Comment (5): Also Trump: I would love to show my tax returns!  Pathetic hypocrite!!!! How can it be that he still has such a strong base??
Comment (6): So why are the Republicans trying so hard to give a future Democratic president the kind of powers that allows them to do whatever they want?  Or is the game plan to never ever again have a Democratic president?  In which case, there's a name for that kind of government.
Comment (7): The President of the United States is a lying piece of shit.
Comment (8): Hmmmm absolutely immune...Where have I heard that phrase? Oh yeah Mick Mulvaney...

Is bullshit
Comment (9): Most people would say "I'm not a criminal" instead of "I'm absolutely immune from criminal investigation"
Comment (10): There are irregularities, much larger than minor infractions, already known.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/02/trump-helped-parents-hide-money-on-tax-returns-new-york-times

https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-inc-podcast-never-before-seen-trump-tax-documents-show-major-inconsistencies/amp

This isn't blindly looking for issues. This is looking at a norm he broke and the past evidence of suspicious activity, much larger than regular inaccuracy.

He looks to be far beyond jaywalking, based on past returns.
Comment (11): He seems oddly sensitive about his taxes...
Comment (12): Well, if there's one thing I've learned about Republicans since the last election, it's that they ignore the laws and never, never admit they're wrong.
Comment (13): > "That President Trump is going to the Supreme Court to try to avoid scrutiny of his finances does not exactly inspire confidence in what will be found in his tax returns,"
Comment (14): I want a president who doesn't \*need\* immunity. I want someone whose biggest hidden crimes are smoking weed a couple times in college or a few speeding tickets. The presidency is about more than policies, it is also about character and ethics. We want the epitome of American ideals representing us; someone with the best interests of America at heart regardless of which party they belong to. Say what you want about Bush or Clinton or any recent former president, at least we can feel they were doing what they truly thought was best for the country. Unfortunately, the current president represents all that it the worst about America and our people. He is a walking representation of the 7 deadly sins. He could care less about the country, and only cares about himself. 

Anyone but Trump 2020.
Comment (15): The Constitution disagrees. 

"The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.”
Comment (16): I thought he said he was 'the most transparent president in the history of the world - EVER' Obviously not.
Comment (17): Nothing shocking about Donald going to these lengths.

It is shocking the WH has lawyers supporting it.
Comment (18): Didn’t Clinton deal with multiple investigations during his tenure? He seemed to be able to deal with that and the office at the same time.
Comment (19): how long will it take him to realize the president is not a private citizen. he doesn't get to hide his bad behaviour from the people.
Comment (20): Nothing he does shocks me anymore. When it comes to him, I think the world has learnt to expect the ridiculous as the norm already.
Comment (21): Remember that in a previous impeachment situation, the President's lawyer [argued](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Nixon#Summary) that the President has an "absolute executive privilege", and is not "subject to the processes of any court in the land except the court of impeachment". This was denied and the President was forced to comply.

If history is any guide, this President should be denied as well. But then again, we live in unprecedented times.
Comment (22): I mean it makes sense to me, as a Russian diplomat he should enjoy diplomatic immunity.

/s because it's 2019
Comment (23): This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2019/11/15/asking-supreme-court-shield-his-tax-returns-trump-claims-he-absolutely-immune) reduced by 66%. (I'm a bot)

Comment (24): Luckily he hasn’t been president for the last 8 years so the years prior to his election, when he was still a private citizen, certainly ARE subject to scrutiny and prosecution. There is certainly enough there to convict him otherwise he wouldn’t be trying so hard to keep them hidden. Tax evasion took down Capone, trump will hopefully suffer the same fate
Comment (25): There is a legitimate point that the President must be able to function without fear of interference to do his job.    **Publishing his tax returns does not interfere with the job of the Presidency.**  Hiding his tax returns is taking time and effort that should be used to serve the people in his role as President.  

I can't see any legitimate legal or Constitutional argument for not disclosing.  Publishing his tax returns would disclose any areas where Trump's personal business conflicts with his role as President.  That means Trump's failure to disclose is inherently corrupt and at odds with his oath of office
Comment (26): Trump could murder someone and the state would not even be able to question him or take his fingerprints. That’s the argument his lawyers are making. According to the argument, the state cannot take ANY steps against him in a criminal investigation due to the so-called immunity. I can’t imagine a more obscene position. This is directly contrary to the notion of our democracy. Did we forget George III and the purposes of our revolution?
Comment (27): If the man is SO innocent, why isn't he also SO transparent. Nobody goes OUT OF THEIR WAY to hide shit if they are innocent.

If Donald Trump would have taken the stand in the Obstruction Investigation, OR if he takes the stand in the current Impeachment investigation and answers all questions for 1 hour straight from both sides.....I may consider changing my opinion about all of this. But that will not happen. They know the moment he steps up there to speak he's going to incriminate himself. Any self respecting person/politician would be PUSHING for the President to do this in order to clear his name. But, the Republicans aren't. Instead they deflect and defend the President. It's sickening and is getting very old.

Edit: Grammar
Comment (28): Lock him up or have the CIA take care of the imminent threat that is trump
Comment (29): With the full blessings of the entire GOP
Comment (30): I cant wait to hear Roberts opinion...... likely to be a pretty blistering refutation of that claim. VERY dumb on the part of Trump's lawyer to actually have used the fifth avenue phrasing in his argument, not that the case had much merit to begin with. I just can't see the SCOTUS granting that level of immunity to all future US presidents.
Comment (31): He’s super evasive for an ‘innocent’ man.
Comment (32): Have any of the Supreme Court justices said anything to hint at how they view this matter yet?
Comment (33): Isn't he essentially asking the Supreme Court to make themselves irrelevant as a co-equal branch of Gov't?
Comment (34): So tired of saying “imagine if it were Obama”,  but ffs imagine if it were Obama.
Comment (35): Because innocent people will *always* go out of their way to not comply with any investigation into them.
Comment (36): It's really not shocking.
Comment (37): Uh, shocking to who exactly? No one who's actually been awake the last three long years.
Comment (38): To have so much power and wealth that one considers themselves untouchable by the laws and the constitution which govern America must be a wonderful thing. At the very least it’s the thought process built up in their own narcissistic mind which resides in a world of delusions of grandeur.
Comment (39): Now the Supreme Court with two Trump appointed judges will decide if the President is a king.
Comment (40): Yet more proof that Donnie thinks "Commander In Chief" is the same as "Dictator In Chief."
Comment (41): I'm confused.  Trump has said on multiple occasions that he would LOVE to release his tax returns.  Nobody wants to do it more than he does.  But for some strange reason, he fights every single attempt to get them.

I think he might be lying.
Comment (42): Well now we will see if he owns the Supreme court or not.  If he does, then I guess we're fucked.
Comment (43): Asking for taxes isn’t a criminal investigation. Unless he knows he’s guilty of something. He must be guilty if he is calling asking for his taxes a criminal investigation, right?
Comment (44): So if Trump thinks he is immune to any criminal investigation, this means the perpetual IRS audit he is under can never result in a criminal investigation. So what’s the point of a perpetual audit if nothing can ever be found wrong?
Comment (45): If you're curious about whether or not Donny boy has the Supreme's in his pocket or not, this is the case to watch.

If they side with Trump, it's a stacked court. If they don't, there's at least some hope of fairness in the future.
Comment (46): God Damn it why is this fucker still in power. All you Republican fucks in Congress are neglecting your duty. Shape up or ship out ass holes.
Comment (47): How can anyone be shocked by anything this buffoon does  ?

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=SjbPi00k_ME
Comment (48): This is at the crux of the Ukraine extortion and bribery that Trump took part in.  He is absolutely terrified to lose in 2020 because he knows he is going to prison.  The ONLY thing keeping him out is the fact that he is POTUS.  The second he isn't he is going to be indicted in NY.
Comment (49): So far he is kicking democracy's ass!  Stunning.
Comment (50): I'm not shocked. I'm more shocked about the adults in the room enabling him.
Comment (51): It's not just Trump. The *official Republican stance* is that presidents are immune from all crimes.

This should terrify every American.
Comment (52): A small shred of me hopes he isn't removed from office after being impeached because that would give Pence  an opportunity to pardon him. Yeah, Trump will still be fucked for state crimes but I'd love to see Trump lose the election and then face multiple criminal charges he can't do anything about.
Comment (53): I don’t wish him dead.  I don’t wish him ill.  I wish him impoverished with a long long life ahead to enjoy it.
Comment (54): Trump is basically saying he is a criminal and he's allowed to get away with it.
Comment (55): I refer to Donald Trump as the garbage man. He wakes up everyday and does not collect, but disperses trash absolutely everywhere. (Side note: I actually have respect for my morning garbage collecting men.)
Comment (56): I wanna talk to the Trump supporter than genuinely thinks he’s going to these lengths and also is totally innocent.
Comment (57): He thinks he’s a dictator. He will lose this case. I’d be surprised if the Supreme Court even took it up.
Comment (58): How is it that his tax forms haven’t been leaked yet?  We have been wanting this for 4-5 years now!
Comment (59): The fact that 2 out of 9 judges were recently appointed by the defendant makes this even more corrupt.

The fact that those 2 don’t recuse themselves from the case involving a defendant who gave them lifelong supreme power is obscene.
Comment (60): And those pieces of shit will most likely oblige.
Comment (61): Immune from what? He's innocent, right?

/S
Comment (62): They should unanimously decline to hear the case. But we all know that won't happen.
Comment (63): Well. That’s quite an admission right there.
Comment (64): Is it shocking though.
Comment (65): So Trump really must plan on staying president for the rest of his life because he knows once he's out of power, then the rest of his life will be spent in court rooms and/or jail cells. His only protection from the law right now is being president.
Comment (66): It is not shocking. Only imbeciles think this. Trump has been a known commodity since the early 1980s.
Comment (67): There must be some real bad shit in those tax returns. He will never voluntarily release them because the consequences would be worse than the consequences of obstruction of justice and he knows it.
Comment (68): Any lawyers here - what’s the actual opinion on this?
Comment (69): This might actually hold up looking how Facebook just dumped money onto Brett Kavanaugh
Comment (70): So when is Congress going to get those tax returns?
Comment (71): Absolutely not shocking
Comment (72): It's a shame that due process takes so long in cases like this.  Trump claims a farcical level of immunity from all accountability, and we have to wait months for his hand-picked judges to rule on it.
Comment (73): Whatever the future holds for this country, this decision by the Supreme Court will be looked back upon as a major turning point.
Comment (74): This whole tax return situation is very intriguing to me. At the very surface it seems so straight-forward: If you have nothing to hide then you release your returns just like every president since Carter. If you have something to hide, then you withhold them from the public and congress.

But...

You could reason withholding of your returns in a similar manner to how it is generally not desired that the government be able to keep tabs on individual citizens: If you're a law abiding citizen, who cares if the government keeps tabs on you? If you're breaking the law then you probably don't want the government to know what you're doing all the time. Is that really true though? People generally don't want the government keeping tabs on them whether they're committing crimes or not.

My point...

If you take a minute to think about this under the, imo, very unlikely assumption that Trump is innocent of any tax fraud then you \*might\* be able to make the reasonable argument that handing over the returns to Trumps enemies could allow them to fabricate a hyperbolized case against him. 

But in reality...

I'm not sure the worry of a potential hyperbolized case is a good legal argument against releasing the returns. Furthermore, you could image a situation where a nonpartisan agency could review the returns to provide congress with the info they need--that could be a potential option for the Trump administration, but Trump hasn't done ANYTHING to get congress the information they need and, to me, this is what makes him seem so guilty.
Comment (75): That statement is an admission the returns contain evidence of criminality.
Comment (76): "NOBODY is above the law"

Also...

"I am immune from being investigated"
Comment (77): If a single person is above the law no matter who he is, then the law doesn't matter anymore. Might as well declare US an empire and install King Turd as our supreme leader.
Comment (78): Days like these it feels like there are no men in government
Comment (79): * **Tax Evasion**: [Trump spent a decade in the "red" after claiming more than $1b in losses](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/05/07/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html).

* **Money Laundering**: [Trump properties are ratholes for Russian money laundering](https://www.newyorker.com/news/swamp-chronicles/where-did-donald-trump-get-200-million-dollars-to-buy-his-money-losing-scottish-golf-club).

* **Fraud**: [Trump belongs in prison for the shit he pulled with the NFL/Buffalo Bills](https://www.si.com/donald-trump-buffalo-bills-michael-cohen-falsified-financial-records). This was outright fraud; and the same federal crime that landed [John Spano Jr. in prison during the Nineties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Spano). And lest we forget, [the obvious](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/10/trump-organization-tax-fraud).
Comment (80): At this point, if something treasonous shows up in his taxes, all of his followers will be guilty of aiding and abetting.
Comment (81): It may be too much to hope for, but I really hope that wherever SCotUS party loyalty lies they realize that the other guy will be in power soon with whatever protections they grant Trump today. I'm not hopeful, though, seeing as how every president in my lifetime has expanded the office's power to act without oversight via XO.
Comment (82): Bring Back The Plague 2020
Comment (83): What a dipshit.
Comment (84): This is exactly what republicans want. They’ve always thought that Nixon got a raw deal and should have been allowed to do whatever he wanted. They hate that more rules for the president were put into place after him. Trump is the useful idiot to many. This is all a test to see how far they can actually push the country before their idiot base pushes back. They want unlimited power which is why they want to keep the electoral college, gerrymandering, voter suppression, etc. They are stacking the courts every week so those useful idiots will rule in their favor every time regardless of the constitution. This has been a slow moving take over since the 70’s.
Comment (85): No one is above the law.
Comment (86): There's a really good video on these tactics in [The alt-right playbook](https://youtu.be/MAbab8aP4_A)
Comment (87): Interestingly enough, the criminal code isn't the legislative document that holds authority over this malfeasance.
Comment (88): Imagine being so deep in the shit you have to run and win the presidency to stay out of prison.
Comment (89): I hope against hope to see this man and his family brought down.
Comment (90): When the guy that you didn’t vote is a fucking idiot and other people can’t seem to grasp that concept .
Comment (91): Is there an estimated amount of time it will take for the court to decide if they will take this up?
Comment (92): Not even the dead are immune to criminal investigations.
Comment (93): Criminals gotta do what criminals do. Anyone surprised of this move?
Comment (94): Well, time to see if the Supreme Court will uphold the constitution or fuck over the US.
Comment (95): He's hiding these perfect tax returns he was going to show us anyway from investigations?  I'm starting to think he's hiding something, like when he wanted to hide the Ukraine call transcripts that ended poorly for him.  /s
Comment (96): I don’t think you’d want to go to court if you were innocent either, would you?
Comment (97): So are we going to keep our Republic? Or make the worst, stupidest human being on the planet our first king?
Comment (98): And yet, if you're shocked by his actions...were you even paying attention to the things he's been saying since he was campaigning?
Comment (99): He’s just shielding them because he wants to release them himself and doesn’t want the fake news media or the crooked democrats to spoil the surprise.

EDIT:  Wow - some of you folks have a really difficult time detecting sarcasm.  Given the circumstances I kind of understand, but sheesh.... lighten up y’all.
Comment (100): Is it really shocking though? Pretty much expected I would think.
Comment (101): Hey look, cutting his quote in half and making up shit about the rest. Again!
Comment (102): So many low IQ people in here jealous of Trump.
Comment (103): What do we honestly expect to see in his tax returns though? None of the allegations relating to impeachment will be supported or refuted by them, so at this point it feels like a pointless diversion. 

We are ticking ever closer to the end of the year and a very long gap in the senate actually meeting for more than a day at a time. There are way more important things to focus on than the questionably-legal requirement of trumps tax returns being released.
Comment (104): What I find amusing is that you guys are great at demanding transparency for public figures, yet there's a surprising lack of information on your website as far as pay/income/employment rights for your employees. So let's hold ourselves up to the same standards we demand of the public employees. Is that wrong?
Comment (105): No one cares about his tax returns except for frothing leftists.  Everyone is entitled to some degree of privacy, including the President of these United States.

Comment (1): Lol:

> “Convicted of a crime I didn’t even commit. Hah! Attempted murder? Now honestly, what is that? Do they give a Nobel Prize for attempted chemistry? Do they?”


> “It’s hard to believe that the Sideshow Bob defense of Trump will be long-lived, as it fails to stand up to even the slightest scrutiny,” wrote Oakley. “It is literally a joke.”
Comment (2): There's no such thing as attempted bribery because to make the attempt is defined as bribery under the law.  It's just bribery.  The crime isn't the transaction, it's the corruption.

https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/201
Comment (3): The Bart, the.
Comment (4): Let's hope his political career ends like Sideshow Bob's too
Comment (5): Fitting, given what a weird sideshow cult conservatives have become.
Comment (6): If you think "attempted bribery" isn't a crime, do me a favor:

Go get in your car get on the highway and do about 90 until you get pulled over.  Offer the cop $200 to leave.  When you get arrested, go to court and tell the judge "well, it didnt work so I didnt do anything" and tell me how it works out.
Comment (7): What a piece of s*** this president is.
Comment (8): POTUS would probably note, truthfully or otherwise, his ratings were better than "The Simpsons".
Comment (9): Simpsons did it?
Comment (10): As always, the Simpsons already did it.
Comment (11): It’s a perfectly cromulent defense. 

/s
Comment (12): At least Sideshow Bob had a little culture
Comment (13): The whole episode is completely relevant today in how it portrays the role of right wing media in demonizing Democrats, indoctrinating the politically naive, and white washing and defending a blatantly criminal republican politician.

Comment (14): GOP: Die Democracy Die

...rest of joke.
Comment (15): So if I attempt to bribe a cop out of a ticket and he doesn’t take it I’m free to go?
Comment (16): can we drop a bunch of rakes on the white house lawn?
Comment (17): Well, there is an argument against the headline. Technically since The Simpsons regularly predicts the future with stunning accuracy, one could say that The Simpsons actually stole Donald Trump's defense as the plot line for Sideshow Bob.
Comment (18): Attempted extortion, attempted murder, attempted robbery, attempted bribery etc.. Attempting to commit a crime is a serious crime. When  the leader of a country is immune from consequences for lawlessness then that country is a dictatorship and that leader is a dictator.
Comment (19): The Democrats need to put a big picture is sideshow Bob up in the hearings.
Comment (20): "Simpsons did it first."
Comment (21): Since the GOP wants to turn impeachment into a circus we should blow up #SideshowGOP on social
Comment (22): "Because you need me America! Your guilty conscious may force you to vote democratic, but deep down inside you secretly long for a cold-hearted republican to lower taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king.  That's why I did this, to protect you from yourselves.  Now if you will excuse me, I have a country to run." -Sideshow Don
Comment (23): > *Plus, the GOP is already moving on to a new argument: that Trump was simply trying to fight corruption.* 

> “ ‘Oh come on now, that’s too much. People won’t seriously fall for that,’ *Sideshow Bob might reply*,” *Oakley wrote*.

Please head over there for the latest discussion
Comment (1): Supposedly Trump made fun of Schiff’s thin neck yesterday at a rally. I can’t believe he thinks being in shape is a negative trait. Imagine the only thing the school bully could make fun of you for was having a thin neck. I’d be like thank you, I work hard so I don’t have a saggy ball sack like yours
Comment (2): Donald Trump says he was fighting corruption in Ukraine.

Marie Yovanovitch actually was fighting corruption in Ukraine.

Donald Trump fired Marie Yovanovitch.
Comment (3): Nunes didn’t say a single thing about Yovanovitch.

Not a single thing.

Think about that in the context of today’s hearing.
Comment (4): Oh. good, he didn't bribe President Z on the *first* call so he must be totally innocent.
Comment (5): HOLY COW HE WON"T LET ME INTERRUPT HIM!!! - Jordan

These Republicans will literally do ANYTHING under the sun for their sound bites and video clips.  This is disgusting.  The fucking chair is trying to speak and you interrupt him and then have the fucking AUDACITY to say that he's interrupting you??? I can't with these people.  

Anyone reading this, if you have children now or in the future, let's please raise our kids to be better than this.  This is EMBARRASSING.
Comment (6): Schiff interrupts his lawyer to say to Yovanovitch: "The president is attacking you on Twitter."

She's asked to respond to Trump saying about her moments ago that "everywhere she went turned bad".

"I don't think I have such powers," she says referring to her time in Somalia.

She says that in all her posts she "demonstrably made things better for the US and the countries that I served in."

"it's very intimidating," she says about Trump's latest words.

"I can't speak to what the president is trying to do but I think the effect is to be intimidating," she adds.
Comment (7): > This spectacle is doing great damage to our country.

The lone nugget of truth in Devin Nunes's opening statement, but a line that preceded it is especially telling:

> By undermining the president who they are supposed to be serving,

None of these people serve the President. They serve the American people, and some of them need to be reminded of that. Remember to register to vote (***EDIT***: and vote). Put every single one of these traitors on notice.
Comment (8): It is just jaw dropping to see these effective, intelligent, and empirical representatives of the state juxtaposed with the fucking GOP clowns.

Comment (10): Stefanik: "I guess you'll just keep interrupting us" she said, *while interrupting*.
Comment (11): Yovanovitch **testifying that she's feeling very intimidated** by Trump's threats, smears and tweets is proof of witness tampering.

Not just evidence. It's proof.
Comment (12): "Chairman, I have a point of order!! You look like a ventriloquist dummy! Point of order!"

"The gentleman is not recognized" 

Jim Jordan: "Jeepers, what a farce by the dems."

Now Yovanovitch is giving her opening
Comment (14): Let's play the "How Many Times Can Republicans Mention Obama, Hillary or Biden" drinking game 

I have my ambulance prebooked
Comment (15): Brett Baier on Fox News right now:   

> Schiff — by casting Trump's tweet against Yovanovitch as witness intimidation — was essentially adding an article an impeachment "in real time."
Comment (16): That outburst from the Republicans was 100% calculated. They know it will create powerful news snippet for fox. They got what they wanted, especially when she got "why won't you let Republicans ask questions", on the record.
Comment (17): About the nude photos Nunes mentioned.  Here is CNNs [fact check](https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/impeachment-hearing-11-13-19/h_c62bae4ce674a9ae9c091ac85293331e).

>In his opening statement, Republican Rep. Devin Nunes said that Democrats had tried “to obtain nude pictures of Trump from Russian pranksters who pretended to be Ukrainian officials.”

>Facts First: This is misleading. While committee chairman Rep. Adam Schiff did take a 2017 call from Russian pranksters who posed as a Ukrainian government official and purported to know of “compromising” nude photos taken of Trump during a visit to Moscow in 2013, Schiff emphasized to the pranksters that he would work with the FBI, not on his own, to receive any related evidence the pranksters could provide.

>The pranksters claimed to have recordings of Russians discussing the supposed compromising material. Schiff said he would welcome an opportunity to obtain copies of the recordings (not the photos themselves) -- and emphasized that he would work with law enforcement to do so.“We will try to work with the FBI to figure out, along with your staff, how we can obtain copies,” Schiff said of the recordings, as The Atlantic reported. 

>Schiff continued moments later: “I'll be in touch with the FBI about this.”A Schiff spokesman told The Atlantic: “Before agreeing to take the call, and immediately following it, the committee informed appropriate law-enforcement and security personnel of the conversation, and of our belief that it was probably bogus.”
Comment (18): What type of brain worms must one have to feel that the articulate and seasoned professional Marie Yovanovitch is wrong but the likes of Jim Jordan, Nunez and Trump are paragons of truth and virtue?
Comment (19): Just wild to see trump try to intimidate a witness on twitter, *as she's freaking testifying!*
Comment (20): As a Brit from across the sea, C-Span really is a Godsend. So much good stuff on here. Watching a NASA Spacewalk atm
Comment (21): Fox News actually acknowledged that Trump's tweet during the hearing was witness intimidation and a crime and another article of impeachment.
Comment (22): Lol she was at an event supporting an anti corruption activist when they recalled her for supposedly being corrupt. Can’t make this stuff up. Good luck trying to break this lady republicans.
Comment (23): Let me explain to you that all these GOP conspiracy theories are bullshit at the start so don't ask.  

 - Marie Yovanovitch
Comment (24): Jesus Christ. Real time intimidation of a witness who is on the stand. From the president. On a global platform.

No sane person can be ok with this.
Comment (25): Counsel: So let me see if I've got this right, you were one of the most senior diplomats in the state department. You've been there for 33 years. You've won numerous awards. You've been appointed as an ambassador 3 times by both Republican and Democratic presidents. And the state department would not issue a statement in support of you against false allegations because they were concerned about a Tweet from the president of the United States?

Tovanovitch: That's my understanding

Oof...

&#x200B;

Then Schiff goes immediately into how Trump is ACTIVELY attacking her on Twitter as the inquiry is happening. THIS IS INSANE!!!
Comment (26):  "Shady actors the world over have learned how little it takes to remove a U.S. ambassador who does not give them what they want."


Preach
Comment (27): "the woman"

Go fuck yourself.
Comment (28): Schiff just proved witness intimidation in real-time. The dude is something else.
Comment (29): Trump, on Twitter, right now:


>Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad. She started off in Somalia, how did that go? Then fast forward to Ukraine, where the new Ukrainian President spoke unfavorably about her in my second phone call with him. It is a U.S. President’s absolute right to appoint ambassadors.


What an absolute asshole.

Comment (31): So our President is now real time slandering a person who has given 33 years of her life to service to this country in some (as the President would call) "shit hole" countries.  Well guess what, the president serves at the privilege of the citizens of the United States, and we would like him not to serve anymore.
Comment (32): This is going to be Republicans talking point today, from https://mobile.twitter.com/christinawilkie/status/1195333307292094464

"New poster up today on the GOP side w a quote from Ukraine’s Foreign Minister, who says he never saw aid tied to investigations. N.B.: This is not the same Ukrainian official to whom Gordon Sondland testified that he delivered Trump’s demands. #ImpeachmentHearings"

Hopefully Dems are prepared for this and shut it down at every turn.
Comment (33): Trump has been tweeting all morning including attacking Yovanovitch But I’d like to highlight what he said about Nancy Pelosi

> Nervous Nancy Pelosi, who should be home cleaning up the dangerous & disgusting Slum she is making of her District in San Francisco

The reason why am highlighting this is because once again it shows that the president does not understand that house of representative members don’t run their districts, He is blaming a federal politician for conditions that would be best addressed by local and state officials.

How can people cheer a president that doesn’t even understand fundamental aspects of American government?
Comment (34): Trump fell in the trap. This, my friends, is only going to increase. Keep tweeting Donald.
Comment (35): [Fox’s Bret Baier: Trump Gave Schiff a New ‘Article of Impeachment in Real Time’ With Twitter Attack on Yovanovitch](https://www.mediaite.com/trump/foxs-bret-baier-trump-gave-schiff-a-new-article-of-impeachment-in-real-time-with-twitter-attack-on-yovanovitch/)

> Weighing in immediately after the hearing went to recess, Fox anchor Bret Baier said that the president gave Schiff ammunition in real time on Friday morning with the attack.


> “That enabled Schiff to then characterize that tweet as intimidating the witness, or tampering with the witness, which is a crime, adding essentially an article of impeachment in real-time as this hearing is going on,” Baier said.


> The Fox anchor went on to opine that that entire nature of Friday’s hearing will change as a result of the Trump tweet — with Republicans now forced to defend, or walk back, the president’s comments.


> “That changed this entire dynamic of this first part of this hearing,” Baier said. “And Republicans now are going to have to take the rest of this hearing to probably try to clean that up.”
Comment (36): Oh god, Trump tweeted:

>Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad. She started off in Somalia, how did that go?

What a moron.
Comment (37): Trump 2020:

20 for Obstruction of Justice

20 for Treason

Comment (39): Fuck this is brutal. Imagine just doing your fucking job, and unbeknownst to you, the president of the United States of America, is promising a foreign leader that *YOU* are going to "go through some things"

Good fucking god. This poor woman
Comment (40): I guarantee you Stefanik has asked for the manager at a Chipotle.
Comment (41): "Certain hosts on Fox"

Please Christ let Hannity get tangled up in this. Please.
Comment (42): Kent’s “piss off corrupt people” quote will be “I’m not a crook” of this period of history.
Comment (43): Fuck Gym Jordan.

That is all.

Comment (46): I love that he quoted Kent. 

>You can’t fight corruption, “without pissing off corrupt people.
Comment (47): GOP is like when I was a substitute teacher for kindergarten. 

Me: "No one will play on computers right now"

Little Nunes: "Ms. Ikcaj, can I play on the computers?"

Me: "No one will play on computers right now"

Little Gym: ""Ms. Ikcaj, can I play on the computers?""

Repeat ten times.
Comment (48): Oh my god, Nunez statement is legitimately making me cringe. This is *embarrassingly*  bad. That new transcript so obviously proves nothing to anyone with even a little bit of critical thinking. Shit man. The Repubs know how to give reporters a spicy headline, but when it comes to something live and deadly serious as this? They are *not* making a convincing argument.

I thought this yesterday, too. It just looks so guilty that they are crying about the hearsay in an investigatory hearing from a witness while simultaneously (paradoxically) using hearsay as definitive evidence that the democrats are corrupt, especially while the democrats are engaging this process so calmly and undramatically.
Comment (49): Love how Schiff preemptively reached for his gavel to shut down Gym Jordan. He is not fucking playing.
Comment (50): CNN is reporting that there is a major discrepancy in the memo released by the White House regarding the April 21 call with Zelensky. They report that when the call was initially described on April 21, the White House released a statement talking about rooting out corruption in Ukraine.

This suggests that either the administration lied about the contents of the initial call on April 21, or doctored the memo released today.
Comment (51): Hearing Nunes read the President's words really highlights how fucking dumb Trump is.
Comment (52): This programming has been brought to you by our sponsors, the 2018 blue wave voters.
Comment (53): I can't wait for the Democrats to ask questions of substance in a sobering tone while Republicans yell conspiracy theories doing their best Alex Jones impersonations.
Comment (54): > How can i gaslight people if i cant even be allowed to speak?!

Gym
Comment (55): If nothing else, I've gained a massive amount of respect for our ambassadors during these hearings.
Comment (56): The firing of Marie Yovanovitch shows the world how easy it is to remove a sitting ambassador to push the agenda this corrupt administration wants. Not just an ambassador but a champion against corruption in Ukraine. Why Republicans can not, will not see this as frightening to our current and future foreign policy is beyond every damn brain cell I have.
Comment (57): Trump is tweeting that everything in Somalia is her fault because she was stationed there....wow.

Edit: Apparently he has deleted the tweet. Probably because someone told him he's a fucking idiot. At least I hope they said that.
Comment (58): "It's very intimidating."

"It's designed to intimidate, is it not?"

"I can't speak for what the President is trying to do, but the effect is intimidating."

"Some of us here take witness intimidation very seriously."
Comment (59): >"As we sit here testifying, the president is attacking you on Twitter," Rep. Schiff tells Marie Yovanovitch. "What effect do you think that has on other witnesses' willingness to come forward and expose wrongdoing?"

>Yovanovitch: "It's very intimidating."

https://twitter.com/JeffreyGuterman/status/1195365263614652416

Witness intimidation, a new point of inquiry for the investigation. Nice job Trump.
Comment (60): Hahah the Republican (Russian) talking point on Twitter is that Schiff actually intimidated her by reading the tweet since she wouldn't have seen it.

 Desperation is getting stronger
Comment (61): #Attention Republicans:

All congress members and witnesses are allowed to hate trump as much as they like. They can be as biased as possible. They can have personal vendettas against him, and they can have wanted to impeach trump as soon as he swore in.

None of that means that they no longer have the power to impeach or investigate the president. It also does **not** mean that any impeachable offense that trump commits does not count.
Comment (62): Call your representative now. 

This cannot stand. If you are in a Democratic district, let them know you support articles of Impeachment. 

If you are in a Republican district, tell them it's disgusting and make them go on record saying it is okay to intimidate witnesses. 

www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative
Comment (63): People who haven't cried in a congressional hearing: Marie Yovanovitch.
People who have cried in a congressional hearing: Brett Kavanaugh.
Comment (64): Gym Jordan: "Ms.Yovanovitch, what gender are you ?"

Yovanovitch visibly confused: "I'm a woman"


Gym: "And what gender is Hillary Clinton ?"

Yovanovitch even more confused: "Female ?!"


Gym : "AHA !!! Do you think we are stupid ? Did you expect us not to see this connection ? This is a farce, a complete farce by the democrats !"

I yield my time, my job here is done, Gym Jordan signing out.
Comment (65): Can’t wait to see Trump live tweet this one, even though he totally isn’t watching it.
Comment (66): "I have a point of order."

"The gentleman is not recognized."

"bUt I HaVe a PoInT oF oRdEr!!!!"
Comment (67): Republicans are like children trying to disrupt everything already. It's cringeworthy and embarrassing
Comment (68): This lady has dodged bullets to serve the USA and Trump smeared her and ruined her career
Comment (69): This lady’s bio sounds like *Homeland.*
Comment (70): She has the voice of a good elementary school teacher.
Comment (71): She is the exact type of person we need in important diplomatic posts.
Comment (72): Her emotion is getting to me. She really is still in disbelief that she was removed for doing nothing but promoting the interests of the United States. I feel so bad for her. Such a strong woman
Comment (73): If Trump has something to say about these proceedings, he should testify, instead of Tweet.

\#TestifyDontTweet
Comment (74): Trump must be absolutely FUMING right now, and nothing gives me more pleasure than knowing we're both watching this right now
Comment (75): Everybody strap the fuck in.

Gym Jordan and the gang are about to crank the spin cycle up to "max" once they come back from this recess.

Its going to be one for the history books, mark my words.

Trump is on the phone right now telling them to deploy any and all smears they can.
Comment (76): None of these hearings would have happened with a Republican majority. Well done, everyone who voted.
Comment (77): *As @kaitlancollins noted, the document the White House released today does not match its official "readout" of the April call. The readout, below, said Trump talked about rooting out corruption and supporting Ukraine's sovereignty. The document shows no mention of either.* ~ Daniel Dale (CNN)

Comment (78): Even Fox news analysts are talking about the witness intimidation on their Twitters.

That was an absolutely huge point in this process.
Comment (79): When you’ve lost Fox....  On Fox News right now:  

Ken Starr says this about Trump's tweet:   

> “Extraordinarily poor judgment. ... I think this was quite injurious. The President frequently says ‘I follow my instincts.'  Well, sometimes we have to control our instincts."   

Bret Baier says this:  

> That was a turning point in this hearing so far.  She was already a sympathetic witness & the President’s tweet ripping her allowed Schiff to point it out real time characterizing it as witness tampering or intimidation -adding an article of impeachment real-time.   

Chris Wallace just said this to Fox News viewers:   

> "If you are not moved by the testimony of Ambassador Yovanovitch, you don't have a pulse."
Comment (80): Watching threads on both subreddits:

politics: "This is some heavy shit, why was she fired? Corruption runs deep and this is information that needs to be heard."

conservative: "This is boring, do something interesting."

I wish I was kidding.
Comment (81): I think Republicans are starting to regret pushing for public hearings instead of closed door.
Comment (82): This woman just shutting down every Republican talking point before they can even question her
Comment (83): She's so eloquent. Career diplomats are so educated and qualified. They constantly show how poor and disgusting this adminstration is.
Comment (84): She just implicated fox.
Comment (85): >Shocked, appalled, devastated that the POTUS would talk about *any* ambassador like that to a foreign Head of State... and it was *me*. I couldn't believe it.

I'm getting so angry on her behalf right now
Comment (86): So, watching Fox it appears their talking points today are 

"The president has the authority to fire an ambassador"

Which nobody is debating. Of course he has that authority. The question is why. Why they fuck can't they address this point?

EDIT: Looks like Donnie Moscow has weighed in on this pressing issue. In his latest tweet. 

"It is a U.S. President’s absolute right to appoint ambassadors."
Comment (87): Schiff with grand slam right there. Witness intimidation on the record.
Comment (88): This hearing is being broadcasted live all over the world. It's on youtube FFS. 


Adam Schiff bringing up real time tweets of trump throwing a tantrum humiliating him to a max possible audience is an absolute power move. Big dick energy was created for this moment.
Comment (89): bringing up the tweets may look silly on the surface but it actually is quite genius. Republicans were going to drill her, that it was her opinion that Trump was against her and Trump was out to get her. I think with those tweets it is going to be hard for them to play that card. Our great stable genius. 😂
Comment (90): I am laughing at the idea of the panic ensuing in the White House while Trump rage tweets at Yovanovitch and the aides see Schiff reading the tweets out loud in the hearing... omg
Comment (91): Is he seriously live tweet threatening a witness?!?!
Comment (92): The Dem counsel is like a real life Atticus Finch, I want him to adopt me god damn
Comment (93): Lol "Cspan caller here totally democrat but here's why this is a witch hunt orchestrated by the Jews now listen as I spout off right wing talking points, I'm a democrat by the way"

Do people just have so little to do they call in pretending to be a democrat so they can spout their nonsense or are republicans paying these people?
Comment (94): Funny how trump stopped tweeting as soon as he got called out for witness intimidation
Comment (95): I hate the notion that we should just wait for the election to sort this out. The accusation is that he’s trying to use the power of his office in a corrupt manner to tilt the election in his favour.

It’s like saying “yeah he’s accused of robbing the bank, but we should wait for the banks year end financial statements to see if it really affected them”
Comment (96): lofuckingl

"Fox News Senior Capitol Hill producer: "Now, when we look at the U.S. Constitution and look at Article 2, Section 4, it doesn't say anything about witness intimidation."

https://twitter.com/LisPower1/status/1195372163127283712
Comment (97): > Asked about President Trump’s tweet smearing the reputation of Ambassador Maria Yovanovitch while she was testifying, Politico reports Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA), the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, responded: “I don’t comment on committee business.”

Well, that's a new one, Nunes...
Comment (98): >[Stock Market up big. New and Historic Record. Job, jobs, jobs!](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1195379578358960128)

Trump just now...but I thought impeachment was going to tank the markets?!
Comment (99): Holy shit. Reading an active tweet from Trump. That's insane.
Comment (100): Trumps tweet of nine minutes ago

> We have vacancies in various departments because we do not want or need as many people as past administrations (and save great cost), and also, the Democrats delay the approval process to levels unprecedented in the history of our Country!

It should be pointed out that the approval process happens in the Senate which is Republican controlled, it should also be pointed out that that same Republican Senate refused to even give hearings to Obama appointees like a hundred federal judges and the supreme court nominee.
Comment (101): Just fyi, all the "oh jeez" and "holy moly"s by republicans as they attempt to talk over others is political theatre to martyr themselves and establish a narrative that they're being treated unfairly. Fact is it was not their time to talk. Don't get fooled by horsehit.
Comment (102): The gentlemen can shove the point of inquiry up his ass
Comment (103): Lol gym Jordan saying this is not witness intimidation because she wouldn’t have seen it real time.
Comment (104): Ladies and gentlemen. The Republican kindergaten.
Comment (105): The Republicans are trying to interfere to control the day in bad faith.

DON'T LET THEM. SLAM THE GAVEL.
Comment (106): Welp I'm drinking a beer at 9:30 AM here we go
Comment (107): she has the school teacher voice, the GOP is fucked
Comment (108): This is a very smart woman.
Comment (109): I love that she's getting ahead of the bullshit repubs will try to ask ahead of time
Comment (110): I am enjoying this adult interaction...I do not look forward to the Nunes and Jordan screeching in our near future.
Comment (111): Once again, it's awesome how easy it is to give yes or no answers when you aren't lying or have an ulterior motive. The truth is easy!
Comment (112): What a moving opening statement. Ambassador Yovanovitch represents everything these Republican clowns do not: grace, integrity, competence, and a keen sense of duty to the country.

It saddens me to think that she was removed so unfairly, and it outright depresses me that foreign service officers of her caliber are questioning their value to this country, and considering leaving their difficult and critically important jobs.
Comment (113): Wow, they're juxtaposing the story of the activist attacked by acid with the phonecall about the Ambassador's security. This really hammers home the idea that Trump placed his Ambassador in physical danger.
Comment (114): Worse than Watergate.
Comment (115): God, I can't wait until we can stop referencing the tweets of the fucking President of the United States and have an adult in the Oval Office again.
Comment (116): Did he just pull a Trump live tweet?!!! FUCK YES! This is exactly what they should be doing. That’s going to drive him nuts.

Maybe we can get Trump to testify via live tweet
Comment (117): Schiff: would you like to respond to everywhere you've gone has turned bad?

Yovanovitch: I've never been to trump Taj Mahal Atlantic City, sir!
Comment (118): *The president is bullying and smearing Yovanovitch as she testifies to facts in front of Congress. She's not smearing him or lying about him or making judgmental conclusions about him.*

*He's intimidating the witness in real time on Twitter.*

From [here](https://twitter.com/jonallendc)
Comment (119): This is surreal. Attacking a witness testifying AS WE SPEAK
Comment (120): Schiff with the case for witness intimidation in real time. This is really something.
Comment (121): SCHIFF: Knock, knock.

GYM: Who’s there?

SCHIFF: The Gentleman.

GYM: The Gentleman who?

SCHIFF: THE GENTLEMAN IS *NOT* RECOGNIZED.
Comment (122): This is straight up insanity land. The PRESIDENT live slandering a witness to his impeachment. This alone should have him thrown out of office. This alone shows how unfit he is to serve. He is rotten to his core and ANYONE who defends this behavior is complicit and should not serve in public office of any kind.
Comment (123):  Jordan And Nunes smirking as Ambassador Yovanovitch testifies that Trump threatened her is a perfect snapshot of these childish bullies that are the GOP
Comment (124): Schiff giving Trump a verbal middle finger on national TV by calling out his tweet with millions of people watching is the highlight of my day.
Comment (125): Responding to a tweet live in an official impeachment inquiry is definitely going to go in history books. It perfectly summarizes how influential social media is in our society and politics. Hopefully it helps them understand these times.
Comment (126): Witness intimidation in real time on television. What a time to be alive. Rofl.
Comment (127): I thought Trump was too busy to watch these "joke" hearings.
Comment (128): This is one of the best direct examinations I've ever seen. 

He already had a hell of a legal reputation, but Daniel Goldman will be considered among the best of the best, from here on.
Comment (129): Imagine being attacked by the fucking *President of the United States* while a million cameras are pointed at you, and you just have to keep your composure.
Comment (130): You know what innocent people do?

Attack witnesses on twitter when they are "to busy to watch the hearings".
Comment (131): Today's hearing is definitely *NOT* boring

Wow
Comment (132): One of the comments in /r/conservative pointed out that the President can remove diplomats at their discretion. This is absolutely true. 

And yet the administration still chose to lie.

All the administration had to do was articulate a shift in Ukraine policy and recall her. That's all.

And yet the administration still chose to lie.

Not only did the administration lie about her, they used informal back-channels to do it--back-channels comprised of people who did not represent the US government in any formal capacity.
Comment (133): Ken Starr on FOX: President’s tweet was very ill advised and very injurious.
Comment (134): How this New York Yankee fuck got all these southerners to support him is beyond me.
Comment (135): I love how the Republicans try to defame the Democrats by saying things like "They've been trying to impeach Trump since he was sworn in". 

Yeah, because he has been unfit for office and breaking laws since day one in office
Comment (136): c-span caller: "they need to stop asking how she feels"

"so what would you ask?"

"well uhhh how does she feel about it?"

bro what
Comment (137): Lol the transcript Trump released today doesn't match with the summary that was released back in April. 

They claimed to have spoken about corruption in the original summary, but there's no mention of it in today's transcript.
Comment (138): I'm learning a lot of shitty law from the GOP.

If I ever decide I want to rob a bank I will not do it the first time I go to said bank. That way, later, after I do rob it multiple times and I'm being prosecuted, I will show them a footage of my first visit to the bank: "See how perfect it was? I clearly did not rob the bank that one time, so please dismiss this sham trial".
Comment (139): Well, it finally happened. My F5 key just literally broke.
Comment (140): Apparently they are voting on something unrelated to this hearing. Further disproving the republicans main argument about how they have better things to be doing to help the country, even though they are taking the time to do just that.
Comment (141): "Stupidity got us into this mess and stupidity will get us out"

\-Republicans
Comment (142): https://twitter.com/MarshallCohen

Roger Stone has been found GUILTY ON ALL COUNTS, including false statements to Congress, obstructing Congressional proceedings, and witness tampering. (h/t @kpolantz @Geneva_Sands)

YALL!
Comment (143): Roger Stone found guilty on all 7 counts. Not a good day for Donald
Comment (144): There are a huge number of sources providing live streams, audio streams, live blogs, and more of today's Hearing.

Obviously we can't feature them all, so feel free to share links to your preferred source as a reply to this comment!
Comment (145): **WITNESS. INTIMIDATION.**

In **real time.** Called out during a **live broadcast.**

Holy fuck we just witnessed history.
Comment (146): Sharing from another user in the previous thread:

Sealioning:

Sealioning (also spelled sea-lioning and sea lioning) is a type of trolling or harassment which consists of pursuing people with persistent requests for evidence or repeated questions, while maintaining a pretense of civility and sincerity. It may take the form of "incessant, bad-faith invitations to engage in debate".

Keep this in mind as you watch the Republicans attempt to derail the hearings.
Comment (147): So, more screaming and nonsense from the GOP today?
Comment (148): Screw that tweeting douchebag. "I'm not watching" headass, I hope he enjoys this.
Comment (149): Ambassador Yovanovitch looks like a lady that takes no ones shit. I think I love her already.
Comment (150): That quote by Kent is so amazingly applicable
Comment (151): The Gentleman is NOT recognized!
Comment (152): "Gentleman is not recognized".

I am honestly impressed by Schiff.
Comment (153): Schiff is shutting shit down.  I am actually surprised they are shutting up when he says to do so.  I have gotten so used to the rules just being tossed that it feels weird that they are listening.  I mean, they are awful and they make my skin crawl but I am glad they don't just keep going.
Comment (154): Schiff: the gentleman is not recognized 

*they were in fact not a gentleman*
Comment (155): $20 says nunes purposely read the "transcript" over time so Schiff would cut him off, then GOP/right wing media could say "Schiff cuts off nunes as he tries to read transcript, proof the dems have nothing!"... Well played Schiff.
Comment (156): One of the best things that can come out of this is that the American people can realize how lucky we are to have talented and dedicated people like Bill Taylor, George Kent, and Marie Yovanovitch toiling on our behalf in countries all around the world.  We owe them a huge debt.
Comment (157): 15:39 here in Switzerland, watching while working and I'm dumbfounded by how the republicans behave. Good luck America
Comment (158): She's impressive so far - it's crazy that she has to defend herself before Congress in response to the smear campaign against her by Trump and his criminal administration.
Comment (159): This woman seems pretty unflappable. Wonder how she will handle questioning from the loud talker. Probably with ease.
Comment (160): Trump  " she doesn't look like Miss Ukraine"
Comment (161):  Yovanovitch lays out how the motives of those working to get her fired were driven by personal, financial gains.  --- CORRUPTION plain and simple
Comment (162): I love how she anticipated their bs and addressed it up front. This is damning.
Comment (163): FYI.  She is a highest-ranked female ambassador at the State Department
Comment (164): Jim Jordan Tweeting on his phone while Marie Yovanovitch gives her opening statements.
Comment (165): FUCK YEAH SCHIFF reiterating Kents, "You can't fight corruption without "pissing off corrupt people"" to Marie.  

Pretty sure all the repubs ass cheeks clenched who were in there.
Comment (166): Giuliani attempted to overturn a visa denial for a corrupt Ukrainian?!

Edit: also stated was the visa was denied specifically for the guy's corruption.
Comment (167): MAGA

  Man,

  Arrest

  Guiliani

  Already
Comment (168): Trump rage tweeting at Yovanovitch bc she's a woman. For him, an easy target. Notice how he didn't do that for Kent or Taylor.
Comment (169): She's so gracious under fire.  I can see why she was a 30 year diplomat.
Comment (170): this lady a god darned hero

and trump is currently trying to smear her on twitter

like fuck you bro

fuck you
Comment (171): "the woman" fucking sexist piece of shit...
Comment (172): "She's bad news" and "she's going to go through some ~~bad~~ things" are the most inarticulate threats I've ever heard.  Clearly threats, but jeez.  Get a fucking vocabulary.

EDIT: "bad" isn't in the quote.  My bad.
Comment (173): "...the transcript -- or the call record, rather"

*Thank you* Goldman for catching that, and making the correction. Because it's not a fucking transcript.
Comment (174): Quick reference for these witnesses

https://intelligence.house.gov/defendourdemocracy/

Key excerpts of Yovanovitch's deposition https://intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/20191104_-_yovanovitch_transcript_excerpts_final.pdf

Q: Also on page 4, at the top, President Trump said, “The former ambassador from the United States, the woman, was bad news and the people she was dealing with in the Ukraine were bad news, so I just want to let you know that.” Do you see that?

A: Yes.

Q: What was your reaction when you saw that?

A: Again, I hate to be repetitive, but I was shocked. I mean, I was very surprised that President Trump would—first of all, that I would feature repeatedly in a Presidential phone call, but secondly, that the President would speak about me or any ambassador in that way to a foreign counterpart.

Q: At the bottom of that same page, President Trump says, “Well, she’s going to go through some things.” What did you understand that to mean?

A: I didn’t know what it meant. I was very concerned. I still am.

Q: Did you feel threatened?

A: Yes.
Comment (175): Republicans: "ambassador... If Trump stood on 5th Avenue and shot you, would you think Obama's birth certificate is in Hillary's emails?"
Comment (176): Yovanovich's testimony is damning. It's destroying the laughable idea that Trump was interested in anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine by clearly laying out how he got rid of her for her anti-corruption efforts. And the threat, goddamn.
Comment (177): Yes schiff reading out the tweets calling out trumps bullshit
Comment (178): Fucking brilliant, Schiff.  Well played.
Comment (179): Oh snap.  Trump getting real-time called out on his BS, this is awesome.
Comment (180): FUCK IT, WE'LL DO IT LIVE!

- Schiff, regarding responding to Trump's Tweet rants
Comment (181): REMINDER ABOUT THE TWEET HE JUST READ! IN IT TRUMP STATES: 

>Then fast forward to Ukraine, where the new Ukrainian President spoke unfavorably about her in my second phone call with him.

In  the second call Z referenced Trump telling him Yovanovitch was a bad  ambassador, but in the first call, as we now know, there was no  reference to her. Which implies he was told via the back channel. 

&#x200B;

GOT EM
Comment (182): We live in a time Congress is calling out the President who is live tweeting his own impeachment attacking the witness. 

**Turning on the LHC was a huge mistake**
Comment (183): Schiff proving obstruction of justice is happening live. Republicans won't buy it but fuck is that damning evidence.
Comment (184): **Witness intimidation** in real time! Add it to the impeachment counts
Comment (185): Witness intimidation by way of Official White House Statements.
  
On the record in an impeachment hearing.
Comment (186): He just committed Witness Intimidation live on National Television.

What the actual fuck?
Comment (187): HAHA making that strong case for witness tampering in REAL TIME!

This is crazy shit. Madlad Schiff.
Comment (188): Proving witness intimidation live. Amazing
Comment (189): WOW. Witness intimidation DURING a testimony. Good lord.
Comment (190): I like that Schiff noted that he takes witness intimidation very seriously.

Please add that to the articles!
Comment (191): As Yovanovitch testifies that Trump was intimidating her, he takes to twitter to... intimidate her more.
Comment (192): Schiff basically dared Trump to tweet about her again. If he does, Schiff is going to again call it into the official record.
Comment (193): Ambassador Yovanovitch is a dangerous person to attack. The GOP must tread lightly after her testimony so far.

She is coming off as intelligent, charismatic, and someone who represents our nation the way it's supposed to be done.
Comment (194): This is getting pretty serious. Let this sink in, the POTUS is threatening GOOD american people.
Comment (195): They're actually addressing the Russian elephant in the room. I love it.
Comment (196): Trump just tweeted a memo of the first call, not the actual call being talked about, and it even says at the bottom it is not a verbatim transcript of the call.

He thinks people will think this is the call people are complaining about, when it isn't. Pure distraction.

Jesus.
Comment (197): Lol, the President is live incriminating himself! And they call it out! Delicious!
Comment (198): Holy Fuck, Trump is having a meltdown on Twitter
Comment (199): Jim Jordan is totally gonna blame her for Blackhawk Down, isn't he?
Comment (200): Trump can’t stop himself from tweeting during her testimony. 

Just barge in there, Trump!  Have a meltdown on live tv! Do it!  Show everybody how unhinged you really are. Do it.
Comment (201): The gentlemen can go fuck himself. *gavel*
Comment (202): Schiff is doing Stanford and Harvard Law proud.
Comment (203): Marie Yovanovitch makes me remember why the United States was once a force for good in the world. Thank goodness that professional diplomats like her exist, and will continue to repair the damage Trump has caused long after he has gone.
Comment (204): How is Adam Schiff supposed to do his job if Trump keeps adding new impeachable offenses in real time?
Comment (205): > White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham told reporters earlier today that Trump "will be watching [ranking House Intelligence Committee member Rep. Devin Nunes'] opening statement, but the rest of the day he will be working hard for the American people."

Lol
Comment (206): *Although impeachment doesn’t require a crime, witness intimidation is in fact a crime & be the basis of another article of impeachment. Here’s one part of the relevant law, 18 USC 1512.* ~ Joyce Vance

Comment (207): Chris Wallace on Fox News: "If you were not moved by the testimony of Marie Yovanovitch, you don't have a pulse."
Comment (208): FYI, don't you DARE touch the cspan call ins. This is my entertainment and has been for decades. Listening to white trash ramble is fucking glorious.
Comment (209): Nunes and Gym just exchanged a priceless we are fucked look right after Schiff said... we take witness intimidation very very seriously.

Schiff not playing.
Comment (210): I would not want to play poker with the guy from CSPAN who listens to caller's questions live.
Comment (211): How do I call CSPAN? I can't deal with this conga line of dumb babies saying absolute nonsense. It's like the Disqus comments section of a political article, but with actual people's live voices. The one woman calling in pretending to be a Democrat was transparent as hell.
Comment (212): Y’all should check out the comments over on r/conservative

Like 75% of them talk about how “boring” the proceedings are.  

I’m convinced 75% of sub are straight up bots.
Comment (213): "Because Putin *apparently* wants to take over Ukraine," says a fucking idiot CSPAN caller who apparently doesn't understand that Russia already fucking invaded Ukraine.
Comment (214): Maggie Haberman's take from the [NYT stream](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/15/us/politics/marie-yovanovitch-impeachment-hearing.html) is spot on about what the GOP is trying to do with the April call: 

> The president is [tweeting screenshots](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1195363882489065474) of the rough transcript of his April call with Zelensky that the White House released today. He is trying to conflate it with the far more problematic [conversation in July](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/25/us/politics/trump-ukraine-transcript.html).
Comment (215):  [https://twitter.com/FoxReports/status/1195370077547302913](https://twitter.com/FoxReports/status/1195370077547302913) 

*GOP intel member Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) tells Haley Byrd on her way to vote that she disagrees with President Trump’s tweet attacking former ambassador Yovanovitch.   “I disagree with the tweet. I think Ambassador Yovanovitch is a public servant..”*
Comment (216): Just thought we should all be aware, because it is going to come up over and over again, but this is a DIRECT QUOTE FROM THE NEWLY RELEASED "TRANSCRIPT"

>CAUTION: A Memorandum of a Telephone Conversation (TELCON) is not a verbatim transcript of a discussion. The text in this document records the notes and recollections of Situation Room Duty Officers and NSC policy staff assigned to listen and memorialize the conversation in written form as the conversation takes place. A number of factors can affect the accuracy of the record, including poor telecommunications connections and variations in the accent and/or interpretation. The word "inaudible" is used to indicate portions of a conversation that the notetaker was unable to hear.

This is not a direct transcript, it is just notes. Stop calling it a transcript.
Comment (217): This lady on C-Span praising the ambassador and saying how corrupt the administration is.  Yes!  "Kissing his behind!  Wake up America!"
Comment (218): Let's check in with foxnews... https://imgur.com/Rby6Vv2

Yep, no bias here.
Comment (219): This caller from Tennessee is by far the most rational and sane individual to call into CSPAN this whole half hour. She is indeed right to say that the WORLD knows that what Trump did was ILLEGAL, immoral and unethical!
Comment (220): Hell yeah Vivian. Telling it like it is. "they should play the video of what Lindsay Graham was saying about Donald Trump before he started kissing his behind"
Comment (221): Lol Anderson Cooper: "The White House putting out a statement that turns out not to be true. Wow. I think I've heard that before"
Comment (222): >**John Brennan**: Your comments reflect the despicable nature of your character, hate & fear of our foreign service officers & desperation to protect your corrupt & criminal acts. Your efforts to intimidate will fail. May your downfall be swift, your penalty onerous, & your legacy condemned by all

https://twitter.com/JohnBrennan/status/1195368343412379648
Comment (223): It's hilarious that Trump and the GOP were demanding public hearings.  How is that working out for them?
Comment (224): Republicans have started up the bus convey with which they will throw Guiliani under:

https://twitter.com/kyledcheney/status/1195366919223808001?s=20

>MEADOWS: “This is an impeachment of Rudy Giuliani. But last time I checked, he’s not the president.”
Comment (225): Claire McCaskill is kicking the shit out of Trump and his henchmen on MSNBC right now.

Most scathing commentary I've heard so far.
Comment (226): > Stock Market up big. New and Historic Record. Job, jobs, jobs!

I think Trump is having a brain aneurysm right now
Comment (227): stone guilty counts 1&2...still reading verdict
Comment (228): Stone just found guilty on all counts.
Comment (229): Roger Stone getting found guilty is awesome.

However;

How great is it a high school speech and debate class is taking the time to watch these. That kid made really intelligent observations. That's super awesome, I love seeing youth getting involved in these processes.
Comment (230): Roger Stone guilty of all counts!
Comment (231): President’s Campaign Manger: In prison. 

President’s Personal Lawyer: In prison. 

President’s 1st National Security Advisor: Awaiting Sentencing. 

President’s Foreign policy aide: Served time current Felon.  

President’s Campaign aide: Awaiting sentencing. 

President’s longest political advisor: Guilty, awaiting sentencing. 

President’s current Personal Lawyer: Under federal investigation. 

President’s Ambassador to EU: Amended testimony to avoid perjury. 

So much winning for trump
Comment (232): I'M GOING TO INTERRUPT YOU TO SAY THAT YOU'RE INTERRUPTING ME WHILE I'M INTERRUPTING YOU.

gaslighting mother frakkers.
Comment (233): Can I marry this woman?  Does she have a daughter?  A son?  Can I just be her son?  

So well spoken, so intelligent, showing such dignity.  I am proud of her time an an Ambassador.  Thank you for your service, even if you'll never see this.
Comment (234): [removed]
Comment (235): Trump's now deleted Tweet for those that didn't get to see it:

"Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad. She started off in Somalia, how did that go? Then fast forward to Ukraine, where the new Ukrainian President spoke unfavorably about her in my second phone call with him. It is a U.S. President's absolute right to appoint ambassadors."

Edit: Tweet has not been deleted and is still up. Another Redditor said it was deleted and I was on the wrong Twitter feed and did not see it. Sorry everyone.
Comment (236): Many people are saying Gym Jordan is in shirt sleeves because he remembers in a previous job a voice coming from the room next door demanding “Jacket off! Jacket off!” and it stuck with him.
Comment (237): That threat he made about her is really fucked up and is 100000% not something the fucking President of the United States should be doing.
Comment (238): Perfect sequence by Schiff and Yovanovich
Comment (239): "You saw it here: Witness intimidation in real time by the President of the United States." - Chairman Adam Schiff.
Comment (240): C-Span calls are being brigaded and they need to stop taking calls.
Comment (241): This caller from Tennessee is very on-point.
Comment (242): Nunes is reading the wrong phone call and pretending that's why they are there. Fuck him. I hope Schiff corrects this grandstanding.
Comment (243): Prepare for the onslaught of nonsense from the GOP.
Comment (244): TL;DR of this transcript.

Trump: Good Job.

Zelensky: Thanks, you too.

Trump: Thank you.

Zelensky: Thank you.

Trump: Thank you.

Zelensky: This is a perfect call isn't it? Thanks.

Trump: Yes. Thank you.

Zelensky: Thank you.

Trump: Thank you.
Comment (245): Republicans immediately trying to turn it into a circus again. Schiff doing well to shut them down.
Comment (246): Gym Jordan is worse than a petulant teenager.  What a jabroni.
Comment (247): "and while we are glad he has introduced a single document" ahahah Savage Schiff is best Schiff
Comment (248): And it starts. The republican whining...
Comment (249): "youre going to interrupt us throughout this hearing"

she says as she interrupts the chairman. Jesus christ what a fucking shit show the republican party is. Watch for those clips to be on fox later.
Comment (250): Gym Jordan covered for a child molester and somehow is the best the Republicans can muster.
Comment (251): Jordan is literally trying to get thrown out.
Comment (252): No wonder Trump hates her, she fled Russia, his favorite place.
Comment (253): Schiff is a beast. That focus and resilience during what could only be described as a bunch of 5 year olds jabbering in trying to derail him, gives me chills and hope.
Comment (254): Schiff laying down the law and setting a bright line about Republican clown show antics not being a thing today.
Comment (255): Good luck with this one GOP, she's a god damn national hero
Comment (256): Wait, did you just hear that? I think Jim Jordan just allowed someone else to get raped and helped cover it up.
Comment (257): Jesus Christ this woman is an American Patriot,  Let's see how long it takes these soulless demons to slander her.
Comment (258): Damn, she is well-spoken.
Comment (259): Holy shit, Yovanovitch coming right out of the gate with stories of her courage under fire. Going to be really hard for Republicans to smear her, but they'll still try.
Comment (260): Reminder that Russia hacked the RNC and DNC. They only released the DNC emails. RNC is being blackmailed.
Comment (261): It is people like this and Taylor who keep this country ticking. True patriots. They are what makes me proud to be an American. Not these smug Republicans. This woman deserves someone better than Pompeo and Trump to serve.
Comment (262): Devin Nunes' opening statements are nothing but ridiculous conspiracy theories and flat out lies...and it is effective for the people it needs to be effective for, which is sad.
Comment (263): She’s been in the literal crossfire in her diplomatic service for this country. And the GOP is going to try to ruin her.
Comment (264): "Here's a list of things you're going to ask me about over and over that I haven't a goddamn clue about, now fuck off." -Yovanovitch
Comment (265): This lady is brilliant. I can’t wait to see low-intellect Gym Jordan made to look like the fool he is.
Comment (266): The next Democratic President is going to have one hell of a challenge rebuilding the State Dept.   

trump has devastated the most important arm of the US government and filled it with absolute hacks.
Comment (267): “The gentleman is not recognized”
“The gentlewoman will suspend”

NICE. Schiff isn’t having any of this bullshit. Especially when partisan digs are disguised as points of order. That’s not how this works!
Comment (268): NYT:  Yovanovitch throwing shade at Giuliani: “What I can say is that Mr. Giuliani should have known those claims were suspect, coming as they reportedly did from individuals with questionable motives and with reason to believe that their political and financial ambitions would be stymied by our anti-corruption policy in Ukraine.”
Comment (269): This woman's opening statement is everything. She crystal clear picture she is painting is astounding.
Comment (270): Shorter Yovanovitch:

Rudy Giuliani is a corrupt idiot.
Comment (271): Man, she's throwing enough shade that NOAA is revising their eclipse forecasts.
Comment (272): ...She's so *good*.

I'm ashamed that we allowed that orange bastard and his cronies to sully her name.
Comment (273): Yovanovitch's opening statement was around 9:30 AM. 

Around 9:39 she goes over what she does and doesn't know, including some pre-emptive STFUs for right-wing conspiracy theories. "Partisanship of this type is not compatible with the role of career foreign service personnel."

Shade for Giuliani specifically. "I do not know if Mr. Giuliani believed" the nonsense he claims to believe. Shade for The Idiot specifically. "Nobody ever tried to justify" The Idiot's complaints about her, which began in summer 2018. 

9:49, closing opening statements. Nonpartisanship is kind of big deal for these people. Specific reminder that Benghazi victims were diplomats, and that's why they were attacked. I wonder if Republicans even recognize those people's names.
Comment (274): Jesus christ... she'd make one hell of a VP
Comment (275): "If you fight corruption, you're going to piss off some corrupt people."
Comment (276): This lady looks like she's pissed off a *lot* of corrupt people.
Comment (277): Schiff and Marie adulting!!! 

Now wait until a republican has the mic to watch it all devolve.
Comment (278): laying out the giulani story, how the fuck could republicans POSSIBLY defend this other than outright lying. actually, that was a dumb question, they're definitely going to lie
Comment (279): In case anyone in america is wondering:

We in New York fucking hate Rudy. He's a piece of shit.
Comment (280): I did not know anything about Schiff before this year, but he has certainly made a good impression during these Trump hearings. He has the decorum that you wish for your elected representative.
Comment (281): So trump just blamed the witness for what happened to Somalia.

https://mobile.twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1195356198347956224
Comment (282): Holy shit. This is getting dark.
Comment (283): At least Watergate was domestic, this shit is so much worse. People are dead because of this.
Comment (284): [It didn't took long for the stable genius in the WH to viciously attack Marie Yovanovitch.](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1195356198347956224)

What a disgrace.
Comment (285): Seeing  these respectable career diplomatic officials being caught in the wake of this scandal is heartbreaking to see. You can tell just how much Kent, Taylor, and Yovanovich care about their work in Ukraine and how they legitimately just want to do a good job. I hate how they smeared this lady and are undoing the work she and others did in Ukraine.
Comment (286): She’s such a credible witness. Her first-hand accounts are damning.
Comment (287): "going through some things" - that feels like such a mob phrase
Comment (288): Trump is hate-tweeting about Ambassador Yovanovitch.

He is just absolutely unable to control himself if a woman says something bad about him.
Comment (289): Ho-le-shit.  

She essentially just suggested that she was not being protected, if anything, was being threatened, by her own government.
Comment (290): Trump smearing her now in real time.

Meanwhile, Ms Bad News served 30+ years under multiple Democrat and Republican presidents with no issues. Surely, if someone was "bad news" they wouldn't have good evaluations and be left to toil in international diplomacy for three decades. But that's just my logic and reason speaking.
Comment (291): God, Trumps vocabulary is so limited. It's embarrassing.
Comment (292): "the call record, rather" hahaha... thats right. its NOT a transcript.
Comment (293): My heart is breaking for Amb Yovanovitch.  She teared up -- I don't blame her.  I'd be afraid for every second of my life if the most powerful man in the world threatened me like that.
Comment (294): Fox news and republicans said "she left even before the call, she is not a relevant witness". But OMG. Goldman is killing it with great questions. And she is genuinely hurt. She deserved a better career ending than fleeing from her own and work country feeling threatened.
Comment (295): "It sounded like...a threat."

I saw it as a threat as soon as I read it, too, Ambassador.
Comment (296): Oh my god, tweets in the official record...
Comment (297): I'm waiting for my LSAT score, and I've always considered myself a bright woman, but Goldman is pretty brilliant counsel. I legit have stars in my eyes watching him.
Comment (298): Oh shit Schiff is bringing up the LIVE tweets of Trump continuing to smear the Ambassador.
Comment (299): Schiff with the live tweets!!! This is nuts!
Comment (300): Trumps tweets that are being discussed now should definitely be considered witness tampering
Comment (301): I thought Trump wasn't watching?

Lol
Comment (302): Trump is impeaching himself at the moment.
Comment (303): Donald Trump is the most obvious traitor ever. I genuinely think the first Article of Impeachment should be for Treason
Comment (304): That was the most passive aggressive maneuver from Schiff and I love it lol.
Comment (305): Everywhere that Donald Trump serves goes bad.
Comment (306): Haha Schiff is talking directly to trump watching it holy shit
Comment (307): Schiff is being cold bringing this stuff up when it clearly upsets her, but I think it needs to be seen. The President's actions have consequences in patriotic Americans' lives, this is not a fucking game, and my heart is breaking watching her go through this.
Comment (308): Nice, witness tampering now, this is awesome, go Shiff!
Comment (309): Witness intimidation...add that to the list of impeachable offenses.
Comment (310): Trump is live tweeting witness intimidation
Comment (311): Holy fuuuuck. Schiff: anyways so I started blasting
Comment (312): WHAM!  "We take witness intimidation very, very seriously."
Comment (313): IN-CRED-IBLE that trump's live tweets are incorporated in real-time into his own impeachment hearing. The future is indeed now. LOL
Comment (314): holy shit, "some of us here take witness intimidation very seriously"

fucking chills
Comment (315): Schiff being masterful here using the President's live tweets adding another charge of witness intimidation. LMAO, he's such an idiot.
Comment (316): I feel so bad for her. You can tell she’s a good, honest person & diplomat, and wants nothing to do with any of this, yet she knows she has no choice.
Comment (317): Fuck, every time they quote Trump directly he sounds so damn stupid yet we have people lining up around the block to defend him for money.

Our country truly is broken and here's proofs.
Comment (318): Intimidating a witness. While the witness is on the stand. 

From the POTUS. 

What the hell has happened? 

How the hell do you stand behind someone that does that?
Comment (319): Wow this woman is amazing. Being attacked by the president in real time while giving testimony about the State Department being scared of those tweets.

On national TV, with 10 million+ people watching.

History-making strength.
Comment (320): If nothing else, today's and Wednesday's testimonies really make me proud of the people working in our State Department.  These people are world class humans and true patriots.  They do their patriotic duty daily (often in hostile settings) and show up to testify in front of Congress when called.  On top of that, even after being scrutinized by certain media--American citizens and the very people they work hard to serve--they still manage to testify in a factual and non-partisan basis.  Many members of government could learn something from these heroes.
Comment (321): 33 years she gave to the United States, and she was ousted by one of Trumps dementia rants, wild. Glad shes getting to tell her story live
Comment (322): C-Span is at 121K viewers

Making civic engagement great again!
Comment (323): Republicans are going to be downright cruel to Yov. Just watch. They want to utterly humiliate her. She better get ready. It's going to be disgusting to watch.
Comment (324): Classifying putin as an intelligence officer. Perfect move
Comment (325): In the United States, the crime of witness tampering in federal cases is defined by statute at 18 U.S.C. § 1512, which defines it as "tampering with a witness, victim, or an informant." The punishment for such an offense is up to 20 years if physical force was used, attempted, or threatened.
Comment (326): Kindof historic the way that tweet was used in near-real-time.
Comment (327): I think Yovanovitch would make a dope Sec of State...
Comment (328): Quoting the President’s tweets in real time & asking for a response was quite a moment.
Comment (329): Puts the bullshit "this is boring" narrative the Republicans have been spouting to rest.
Comment (330): This is what a legal counsel in an impeachment hearing sounds like when he has attended class instead of fart parties and 'I love beer'

*And I mean fart*
Comment (331): "But chairman I have an inquiry" 

"Fuck you, we out"
Comment (332): Shout out to all of those who campaigned, donated and voted in 2018. This isn't possible without you. We'd be left in the dark while the Trump administration continued to rape and pillage the country.
Comment (333): "Kindly stick your parliamentary inquiry up your ass." I love Schiff.
Comment (334): Conaway: Mistah Chairman, point of parliamentary inquiry.

Schiff: The gentleman will go fuck himself.
Comment (335): The Dems weren’t lying that her testimony was extremely powerful during the deposition. Holy cow.

She is such a patriot. Extremely strong willed.
Comment (336): For someone not watching the hearings, he sure does wall-to-wall tweeting about it.
Comment (337): They look so stupid with their 4th Grade Book Fair poster boards behind them. I laugh out loud every time I see them.
Comment (338): Adam Schiff and the Democrats conducting this inquiry are crushing it! Way to go US House of Representatives!!! USA USA USA USA. Also thank you to Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch!
Comment (339):  And now Chris Wallace says if viewers were not moved during Yovanovitch’s testimony, “you don’t have a pulse.”
Comment (340): Yovanovitch just gets done testifying that she felt intimidated by the President's comments about her and he then proceeds to double down in real-time on Twitter. He is completely unhinged and reckless.
Comment (341): She was in Ukraine to fight corruption  and ended up having to leave because of her own boss’s corruption.  Fucking sick.
Comment (342): Thank you, Mr. Trump, for adding more witness intimidation and obstruction LIVE to these impeachment hearings. You must have given up listening to Roy Cohn and started listening to your BFF Rudy Giuliani.
Comment (343): LMAO Trump blaming her for Somalia is honestly hilarious. She was posted there in the middle of a civil war and all of a sudden she's Nicolas Cage in Lord Of War as a rookie ambassador.
Comment (344): Lol people are actually spinning it that Schiff is the one who intimidated Ambassador Yovanovitch because *he* read the tweet.

Trump can't be intimidating her because she couldn't read the tweet.

What a bunch of absolute fucking imbeciles.
Comment (345): Watching the CSPAN youtube stream and it's filled with people calling in saying this process isn't fair, and "how can there be bribery if the aid was released?".

Shout out to Jennifer from Kentucky for pointing out that conspiracy to commit a crime is still a crime.
Comment (346): Fox News Anchor [Bret Baier](https://twitter.com/BretBaier/status/1195364536326541313?s=19) (!):

>That was a turning point in this hearing so far.  She was already a sympathetic witness & the President’s tweet ripping her allowed Schiff to point it out real time characterizing it as witness tampering or intimidation -adding an article of impeachment real-time.


>>Fox's John Roberts: Wow....this is really unprecedented.  @realDonaldTrump and Amb Yovanovitch are talking to each other in real time through @Twitter and Television... Something I never thought I would ever see.
Comment (347): After listening to Cspans callers, who were mostly Republicans, I understand why our country is falling behind in education.
Comment (348): If I'm Adam Schiff, I look directly at the camera and tell Trump I know you're watching and I welcome you to come on down and Testify. Trump would flip his lid.
Comment (349): It’s incredible how many of these CSPAN callers have completely missed the point. It’s extremely sad these people are voters, and they represent a *large* portion of the population who think similarly.
Comment (350): That CSpan guy has to have a bottle of scotch sitting there off camera to get through this phone call segment.
Comment (351): Waiting for a call from "John Barron In Washington, D.C" about how this hearing is:

* bad
* sham
* witch hunt
* bad
* bigly
Comment (352): See what I’m not gonna do is listen to boomers call into CSpan and let loose their diarrhea of the mouth
Comment (353): Holy shit, we're getting "her feelings" right out loud from a Republican. They're going for the "emotional woman" attack.
Comment (354): Those reporters on Cspan would have made a better use of their time if they asked toddlers what the sun is made of than talking to republicans in the hallway.
Comment (355): Apparently the blonde Nazi on fox news is trying to sell that Attempted bribery is not in the constitution.  No shit.  Bribery is and Trump failed at that to.  Still a crime.
Comment (356): Yovanovitch is a credit to our entire democracy and the despicable display by the Republicans is proof of their contempt for our rule of law, and every single one of them should be impeached for treason.
Comment (357): Biggest snowflake President in history.  The most stable genius alpha male cannot answer questions himself in person.  What a fraud.

Vows to release his tax returns for 8 years.  Never does.  When they are legally forced to be released, he asks the Supreme court to not release them.   How fucking stupid are you, Trump voters?
Comment (358): Lee Zeldin (R-NY 1st) on C-SPAN is basically saying that voters elected Democrats in 2018 to lower drug prices among other things... The bills are passing the House (which Dems control) and dying on arrival thanks to Moscow Mitch in the senate.

Seems to me like he just inadvertently made a really convincing message for Senate Democrats to run in 2020
Comment (359): CSPAN caller cites Giuliani as a credible source. LMAO
Comment (360): Lol at that "independent" C-SPAN just had on. 

"I'm an independent, but let me just repeat all these right wing talking points"
Comment (361): Man, you guys weren't kidding about the CSPAN callers.

There were a few level-headed people with legit questions/statements but the rest of them were "Why are we talking about a smear campaign against the witnesses? What about the smear campaign AGAINST TRUMP!!!???"

The level of illogicality in these statements are proof positive that critical thinking is no longer required to be an adult.
Comment (362): Republican CSpan caller “she needs to stop giving us her feelings...”
Host: What should she testify about then? 
Caller: She could tell us what she feels would be the impact.... 
😑
Comment (363): Whenever someone says the whistle blower has to come forward, just direct them to the President's tweets on Yovanovitch *while she was testifying*.
Comment (364): Does anyone have a clip of that caller from Tennessee? 

"WAKE UP AMERICA"
Comment (365): Trump just tweeted implying that he only fired her to save the country money on her salary. You've gotta be kidding me

https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1195376390054580225
Comment (366): Jim Jordan says it wasn’t witness intimidation.

Ok there, bud.
Comment (367): These hearings make it blatantly clear that we must have a class on governmental operations and procedures in secondary school for every American.

Make it so each child is a Congress person for the school. Draft real legislation, use actual procedures, etc. Tie it into issues that relate to the school with mock legislation.

If Americans knew how the rules work and how Congress is supposed to operate you wouldn't see these shenanigans from Gym Jordan and Nunes.
Comment (368): Roger Stone is being found guilty on almost every single count. 

100% stick rate on everything so far.
Comment (369): Verdict on Stone Trial complete

[Stone found guilty on all 7 Counts](https://twitter.com/dsamuelsohn/status/1195383158671335427?s=20)
Comment (370): Lmaooo that Epstein caller that’s good
Comment (371): Roger Stone found guilty on all counts.  Couldn't have happened to a nicer guy.
Comment (372): Remind me again how many people in Obama's inner circle went to jail?
Comment (373): Gentleman is not SHUT UP GYM
Comment (374): Stefanik is going to get thrown out to prove a point
Comment (375): imagine watching these republicans and thinking this is dope
Comment (376): Elise Stefanik is a dumbass
Comment (377): [deleted]
Comment (378): Yes,

I love this woman for reading out the names of the Benghazi fallen.

Shame on you Republicans.
Comment (379): These hearings are opening my eyes to how awesome Schiff is. I knew he had to be pretty good because of just how much Trump hates him, but now I see it. Trump is scared of him for good reason.
Comment (380): If these hearings can teach us anything it's TAKE EXTENSIVE NOTES WHILE ON THE JOB. Of anything and all. It could be useful in the future.
Comment (381): I am so glad that these witnesses are just tops.  There is no smearing them, just upstanding people. I am 40ish, so no spring chicken, but I still get a little shocked at how much more adultier some people are than me.  These people are so far out of my league in life, I am glad that they have decided to use their smarts for good and not for evil.
Comment (382): Thank you Mr. Goldman for specifically undercutting the President's latest tweet!

This guy is a boss.
Comment (383): I love watching the counsel ask the questions. The level of professionalism is just on a whole new level. 

You can hear the buildup in real time that what Trump did was simply abnormal and clearly due to the shadow policy being run by Trump - Ghouliani - and Sonderland.
Comment (384): Hearing Yovanovitch testify about hearing Trump threaten her takes on a whole new level of meaning after her earlier description of the Ukrainian anti-corruption activist who was killed in an acid attack.
Comment (385): Trumps vocabulary is a joke. Very good, very bad, very fair, very badly. What a great mind.
Comment (386): Oh man, I hope some congressmen motion to enter Trump’s tweets about Yovanovitch throughout the hearing into the record.
Comment (387): Just a reminder of the ACTUAL order of events. https://i.imgur.com/rnyIq70.jpg
Comment (388): Ugh that latest Trump tweet. "The U.S. now has a very strong and powerful foreign policy, much different than proceeding administrations."   PROCEEDING?  I think you mean "preceding", Bubba.
Comment (389): Now this is a smart move. Schiff is now giving Yovanovitch an opportunity to respond directly, on national television, to Trump's disgusting, bullying rage-tweets.
Comment (390): Calling out his tweet live on TV minutes after he posted it. I love Schiff.
Comment (391): This is perfect - real-time responses to Trump's shitposting. Enter it into the record.
Comment (392): How are his tweets not witness tampering?
Comment (393): Nunes and gym jordan were caught laughing as Schiff was discussing the threatening tweets...

These men are scum
Comment (394): Fucking wimp trump and his fucking asshole son, wouldn’t have the balls to visit some of the places this ambassador has been, let alone live there and deal with such challenging diplomatic situations.
Comment (395): Trump is posting phone transcripts on Twitter. It's like his brain has just completely permanently malfunctioned.
Comment (396): This woman is a boss.
Comment (397): Fox has mentioned how emotional she has been no less than 10 times since the break. 

Can't attack what she actual said, so let's go after how she said it.
Comment (398): Lots of very right-leaning “Democrats” calling in to C-SPAN. Par for the course lately
Comment (399): Republican 1: What if I call CSPAN and claim to be a Democrat and then bash on the process and claim Trump is being persecuted like Jesus?

Republican 2: Genius! I see no flaws with your scheme!
Comment (400): How many of you guys trying to call into CSPAN after listening to all these crazy calls?

It feels like I’m in the comment section of an AOL article like ten years ago
Comment (401): The "there's an election coming" thing is such a bad faith argument. The entire impeachment inquiry is because of potential interference in the election. We're having impeachment proceedings because there's a good chance we won't have free and fair elections next year with the GOP soliciting assistance from foreign countries.
Comment (402): **CSPAN Numbers:**

2027488920 - Democrats

2027488921 - Republicans

2027488922 - Independents

EDIT: Not sure if they're still taking calls, but I found those numbers by rewinding.
Comment (403): Not to be a douche but I don't sense much conviction in the republican callers' comments. They just sound like they're struggling to remember a talking point rather than it being something they truly believe in... because what they're saying makes no sense.
Comment (404): Chris Wallace on FOX: If the Republicans’ argument is “The president has the right to remove an ambassador “ I think they are in trouble. The only way they can counter Yovanovitch without undercutting her is to come out with evidence that she wasn’t good at her job. If they don’t do it, her testimony will go unchallenged.
Comment (405): Trust black women to say it as it is. Thought Trump supporters liked that.
Comment (406): Nunes: This is ridiculous, there is no crime here. There is no quid pro quo! 

Reporter: Mr Nunes are...are you wearing a grocery bag?

\*bottom of the bag tears open and groceries fall out\*
Comment (407): Making a GOP bingo sheet, so far I have: Obama, Witch-hunt, Trump did nothing wrong, whistleblower, “correct?” 

Suggestions?

Edit: [Done](https://i.imgur.com/hhwVx2G.jpg)
Comment (408): GOP stalling on the votes.....Trying to delay as long as possible so people get bored and tune out of the hearings...
Comment (409): Trump: I aint watching no stinking impeachment hearing! 

**Adjusts binoculars with very tiny hands**
Comment (410): Roger Stone was found guilty!

Count 1: Guilty

Count 2: Guilty

Count 3: Guilty

Count 4: Guilty

Count 5: Guilty

Count 6: Guilty

Count 7: Guilty

&#x200B;

( one count of obstruction of an official proceeding, five counts of false statements -- including lying to Congress -- and one count of witness tampering in special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into possible collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election. )
Comment (411): [THERE IS A VERDICT in the Roger Stone trial. He's charged with 7 crimes, including lying to Congress, obstruction of Congress, witness tampering. He'll learn his fate soon.](https://mobile.twitter.com/MarshallCohen/status/1195382444750495749?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet)

Another Trumpian bites the dust.
Comment (412): The fact that Trump restrained himself from tweeting on Wednesday when Taylor and Kent testified, but can't do so when a woman is testifying is fucking sad.
Comment (413): Drink every time they say Hillary or Obama
Comment (414): Manager is out on vacation, all major projects wrapped up as of today. I can sit and watch this all day. Happy Friday!
Comment (415): Did Taco Bell donate to Nunes campaign
Comment (416): “Holy cow” is not what Gym said when he ignored sex offenses.
Comment (417): I suspect today is going to be the republicans trying to go full bore disruption.
Comment (418): Schiff just crapping all over the childish GOP lol I love it
Comment (419): "Point of Order - this lady scares me, please make her go away" - GOP
Comment (420): Let me lay this out.

Soviet-Americans with mafia ties into Ukraine use dark Russian money to buy influence into the GOP, congressmen, governers, GOP state parties, the Trump campaign and Giuliani. There can be sufficient suspicion that there is not only one obscure ex-prosecutor form Ukraine directing this. There could very well be russian intelligence and oligarchs involved in this influence operation.

Then they use the made up honeypot stories to get those GOP to believe them, and change USA foreign policy. With the lead of Giuliani and the tacit help of several cabinet ministers and donors who bought positions in the government. On the side they try to change the board of Ukraine main energy company to be able to sell american LNG to Ukraine.

Now, they all are trying to covering this up and hinder investigations.

This means

Giuliani, Trump, Pence, Pompeo, Perry, Esper, Mulvaney maybe Barr are ACTIVELY COVERING UP a (POSSIBLE RUSSIAN) UKRAINIAN INFLUENCE OPERATION on the GOP and the Republican government. This is where party over country gets you if you are blinded by greed for power, money and wining more power.
Comment (421): Every time she acknowledges a false claim, shes staring into the republicans souls. My god woman, youre killing them.
Comment (422): Career diplomats know how to deal with difficult people and are trained to stand their ground. The way these people have been dealing with republican tantrums shows that.
Comment (423): Rudy is so fucked
Comment (424): And Hanity thought she was going to be crying on que. Talk about not knowing your “enemy”.
Comment (425): Oh shit. Fox News mentioned directly.
Comment (426): This woman is an American Hero.
Comment (427): Finally someone rightly putting a target on faux news
Comment (428): This woman is ripping apart the orange idiot's entire foreign policy, but the Republicans will stick to the one question they know will make for the best sound-bite after the hearing - "were you on the call?". 

Fuck the GOP and fuck everyone who has been supporting them all this time.
Comment (429): Trump lost confidence in being able to exploit the corruption in Ukraine with Yovanovitch there, an exemplary and principled ambassador.

So he got rid of her. That’s what it sounds like.
Comment (430):   interesting that Trump was basically able to stay away from attacking Taylor and Kent in personal terms on Wednesday. But he couldn’t stay away from the Twitter feed when a woman is testifying.
Comment (431): Think about it, Trump was perfectly fine with destroying an entire country if it might help him out in the polls.
Comment (432): "Well, she's going to go through some things."

this is a mob boss calling out the goons
Comment (433): Trump's smearing her in real time on Twitter. Can those tweets be entered into evidence in these hearings?
Comment (434): The Tweeter in Chief is currently smearing this woman on Twitter.
Comment (435): Giving her an opportunity to respond to rage-tweets is a great move by Schiff.
Comment (436): "Everyhere Yovanovitch went turned bad".  Maybe because they sent her to bad places because she's a badass.
Comment (437): Welp.  She just demolished the President, live on the spot, without mentioning his name.
Comment (438): Damn, Schiff is fucking *testy* today. I love it.
Comment (439): Schiff from the top rope.  Real-time witness intimidation.  Remarkable!
Comment (440): I can't believe that trump would tweet about the impeachment hearings as they are happening! Witness intimidation in real time.
Comment (441): Interruptions for live tweet analysis during impeachment hearings.  We are really living in one helluva timeline.  I am so glad these hearings are televised and that we get to watch our reps in action.  I will change my tune shortly when the grandstanding, no questions period begins, but for now I am so fucking into this.
Comment (442): Goldman identifying Russia's talking point to precede Trump pushing for it. Perfect.
Comment (443): Trump is a coward. If he wants to argue his points, he should go under oath and testify. Release documents, stop obstructing.
Comment (444): >Mika Brzezinski:
Does Trump KNOW his tweets make things worse. Could he possibly have no idea?? WOW

https://twitter.com/morningmika/status/1195362819736264704
Comment (445): Isn't Trump committing a crime by live tweeting about the impeachment hearing?
Comment (446): I'm just tuning in, but I caught the motion. The republican members have been abusing parliamentary procedure as damage control to interfere with the process in the form of a delay tactic. They've been doing this since the Kavanaugh hearings. "Motion to adjourn the meeting." Then a vote, then "Motion for a roll call on the vote". Just like that, 20 minutes wasted. Do it enough times and a full hour could be cut from the testimony. I don't know what the Madison rules state, but Robert's Rules only allow a point to be brought up once, then once dismissed it cannot be raised again. I bet the republicans have a long list of unrelated points of order to raise.
Comment (447): The one thing that strikes me about these witnesses, Yovanovitch, Taylor and Kent, is how intelligent and well-spoken they all are. I'm used to people like Bill Barr, mumbling partisan nonsense and lies, to protect their corrupt President. This is so refreshing.
Comment (448): Holy fuck the cspan callers are so cringe.
SUBMISSION (6): I used to work with Bill Taylor — and I find the Republican smears on his character difficult to stomach. 'Just Bill' was one of the kindest and most principled people I have ever worked with.

Comment (1): That's crazy to me. I mean, if you only look at Taylor:
5th in his class at West Point. Served in the infantry in Vietnam.


Compare w/ a 5 time draft dodger, crook, conman and systemic sexual predator.
Comment (2): It was a pleasure to hear him speak during the hearing.

Articulate, competent and obviously dedicated to his job and public service.
It’s so surreal to watch the contrast between US officials like Bill Taylor, and president Trump.

I’d normally expect more competence and credibility coming from the highest office in the country, but that’s not what you get from Trump at all.

I’m still baffled how Trump can still hold so much support when he represents US so poorly.
Comment (3): You just have to remember this is a cult we're dealing with and it all makes sense. They would attack Jesus if he came down and testified against Trump. I'm not exaggerating one bit.
Comment (4): On top of the atrocities Trump and gang have committed, everyone should be reminded of the fact that they are ruining people’s lives and careers simply because they were involved and they are speaking the truth.
Comment (5): It's not like Trump the Traitor or his GOP lackeys respect dedication to the country. Just dedication to Trump and the party.
Just like with Vindman their shameless behavior has no boundaries.
The rest of the GOP is just sitting back scared.
Comment (6): There's no way you could have watched his testimony and come away with thoughts other than: This is a smart, principled guy who clearly cares about serving his country to the best of his abilities.

I found him extremely impressive
Comment (7): Where's Pompeo in all of this? He was the one who coaxed Taylor back into government service. Hardly any public words of support from him.
Comment (8): How are the Republicans still even a party? I dont think there is any organization on earth so full of liars, sycophants and cowards. It blows my mind that there are enough people in the US who cant see that or dont care that they remain a viable party. Despite they way our technology makes it seem, we're still living at the tail end of the dark ages as far as I'm concerned.
Comment (9): Reminder to GOP voters: these  people will turn on you, too, if it means they can stay in power.

They have no principles. Just the accumulation of power.
Comment (10): I was so impressed by both witnesses even ensuring to state that they are non-partisan Govt. employees who have worked under 4-5 different administration's each while also saying their only there for the sake of the country and not partisan BS.....

Meaning.. objectively the world should take them seriously. Which I really hope it does! Even though I've seen the Fox TV spins already...

Sadly, when they started to take down Vindman's character, I was gobsmacked! I thought that at the very least, they know better than going after vets who even have a purple heart.
Comment (11): I would feel honored to have both Taylor and Kent, and their families, at my house for Thanksgiving. They are true heroes in my book and I’m in awe of their bravery and patriotism! 

Trump and his minions can go sit on a manure pile. If they catch it at just the right time it might still be warm!
Comment (12): Republicans can only attack the people and the process because they have no defense.
Comment (13): I got tears when he was asked about his valor ribbon and time served. Dude seems to be so genuine
Comment (14): Bill Taylor is a better American patriot than 90% of today’s Republican Party.
Comment (15): George and Bill both seem like stand up men. They both gave very balanced and fair testimonies, and put up with the Republican bullshit really well.
Comment (16): Are you shocked? You saw what they did with Mueller. Vietnam vet and career public servant who is the epitome of justice and fairness. Literally screaming at him during his testimony like he was part of some secret scheme to take down the president while also claiming his report exonerated the president.
Comment (17): More excruciatingly, half of your fellow Americans appear to be ok with it. It’s insane that they cannot see that before them is a principled and patriotic man. Instead, they side with the buffoons. Makes you wonder whether your civil war ever really ended. Makes you think that a large proportion of your society are basically neo-nazi’s who - with their troll-in-chief - just want to burn morality to the ground.
Comment (18): What we are seeing folks is the demise of our Republic. When people like Bill Taylor are smeared by what I like to call the Snowflake King and his dirty snowflakes ,it is truly horrific. Every voter must get out and vote in November so we can restore honor to the Executive and Legislative branches.
Comment (19): They all looked like stupid, aggressive assholes. It was hard to stomach.
Comment (20): Republicans don't give a shit about kindness, principles, or character.  They care about money, power, and themselves.

What they have mastered, surprisingly, is convincing 40% of Americans that kindness, principles, or character don't matter.
Comment (21): "kindest and most principled people I've ever worked with" that's exactly why they are and have to smear him. He the antithesis of everything tRump and the Republicans are and stand for.
Comment (22): The military and ex-military and long-standing civil servants should be protected when questioned by congress.  There should be a law that prohibits attacking their character or advancing crazy theories with no basis in fact.  Lies are lies.
Comment (23): They eat anyone who doesn't fall in line.
Comment (24): Well, I don't know what Bill Taylor's political affiliation was, but I bet he's a Democrat now. Good going, GOP.
Comment (25): They have done this to everyone who has dared stand up to Donald Trump. Everyone. 

It doesn't matter what your political allegiance is, if you disagree with him, his pack of rabid morons will fall on you and tear you to pieces.
Comment (26): I can’t imagine being fortunate enough to know this guy personally
Comment (27): We haven’t seen the worst of it yet. Wait until Alexander Vindman testifies. It’s going to be a disgusting display of questioning the patriotism of a Purple Heart veteran because he’s an immigrant, and questioning his loyalty to America because the country involved is the one he left when he was *3 years old.* The man spent every year of his childhood he could possibly remember in living in New York, but that won’t matter.
Comment (28): They cant stand anyone with real principles.
Comment (29): Unfortunate but not unexpected.  Repugs will literally smear anyone and everyone in their efforts to protect their criminal president.
Comment (30): Taylor seems like he'd smell like cookies and integrity.
Comment (31): The Republicans have so tied themselves to Trump that they'll throw literally anyone under the bus who could possibly hold him responsible for his actions. History will not treat these people kindly.
Comment (32): He seems like a sweet and thoughtful guy tbh
Comment (33): He and Kent both came across as people of integrity who truly had the best interests of Americans (and Ukranians, too) at heart.
Comment (34): Bill Taylor 2020
Comment (35): When I described Taylor to my husband I described him as someone who seems like a very kind and intelligent man with a great sense of humor. I had only watched him for a few hours. I can only imagine how many people who know him are angered by the attacks on his character.
Comment (36): I loved how eloquently and clear he spoke. Has an amazing voice. 

I couldn’t decipher though if he’s pro or anti trump?
Comment (37): Screw electing presidents just let the unelected swamp trash run the country said no one EVER!
Comment (38): "I heard it from a friend of a friend that a close personal friend said he's a great guy."  Everyone said that about OJ too.
Comment (39): Ummm wtf? Stating that someone’s claim is secondhand is not a smear... it was a fact.

Taylor even acknowledged (repeatedly) that he was only saying what others told him and could not speculate beyond that.

You guys really need to not be such emotional idiots all the time.
Comment (40): Honestly, the smears are accurate these days.  The problem is that opposing something Trump does is partisan, but Trump keeps doing really terrible shit, so if you're principled, you have to oppose Trump and therefore be partisan.  When the facts are overwhelmingly against one party, it's partisan to stick to the facts.
Comment (41): >Ambassador Taylor recalls that Mr. Morrison told Ambassador Taylor that I told Mr. Morrison that I conveyed this message to Mr. Yermak on September 1, 2019, in connection with Vice President Pence's visit to Warsaw and a meeting with President Zelensky.

Star witness...
Comment (42): Joe Biden is guilty of what Democrats are accusing President Trump of doing and President Trump is Innocent.
Comment (43): You mean 2nd or 3rd hand Bill Tayor? The Charge de affairs Bill Taylor who admitted that the Ukrainian Ambassador was not lieing when d p stated he was never pressured? The Bill Taylor that couldnt find anything illegal in the transcript of the phone call?

This whole thing is laughable. Try again 

Mueller Russian Collusion - hoax. Mueller obstruction of justice - hoax
Ukrainian quid pro quo - hoax
Comment (44): Maybe William Taylor is actually a good guy but it is ridiculous when people come out to defend their political buddies. Like when Joe liberman came out to talk about how great John McCain was even hafter he sang his song about how he want to bomb Iran. Or when people talk about how caring trump is behind closed doors.

Politicians are the lowest scum of society. It's a whole class of sociopaths who are out to get their own and screw everyone else under. None of them are good people. Articles like these are proof that operation mockingbird is working.

Comment (1): It already doesn't - but the fact that we have to go up to the supreme court every single time Trump breaks the law give him plenty of time.

Presidential cases involving constitutional crises should skip straight to the SCOTUS at the front of the line with an early decision.   These cases are too important.
Comment (2): Trump is exploiting his current position, treating it like a corporate takeover.  He is using all means possible to cause as much damage as possible.  This is the norm for Trump, and will end badly like the rest of his business ventures.
Comment (3): The GOP has never cared about the law or the people.
Comment (4): That's exactly the point of impeachment. To reign in the executive and force them to behave lawfully and with dignity befitting a President.

The whole concept of America is based on respect for the constitution and the laws of the land. We cannot tolerate a rogue President who is above the law.
Comment (5): This needs to be talked about more in the media, and to be honest should be the reason the senate should vote to remove from office.

Congress shall have the sole power of impeachment. If the executive branch can obstruct congress and refuse to participate in impeachment, it undermines this power of congress to hold presidents accountable. This should be a concern for everyone in government, because if the precedent is set that a president can do what they like and ignore the powers of congress it, eventually it’ll happen that a democrat does this - how will the republicans feel then?

This will inevitably go to the Supreme Court- hopefully sooner rather than later - and it should be a no brainer for them. Despite the court being stacked with conservatives, I’d find it extremely hard to believe they can justify a decision that undermines the constitution and the powers of congress to impeach. They will likely rule that the executive branch does not have the power to refuse subpoenas or refuse to release information to congress as it relates to impeachment.
Comment (6): Don’t write stupid headlines that lead people to believe it’s even acceptable because it isn’t. This is a bullshit tactic carried out by a party. 

I hate that our media still wobbles it’s way back to the GOP being a good team player here. They arnt. They are the enemy.
Comment (7): It shouldn't have power at all when improper behavior is suspected.

There are two ways to remove a president: impeachment, and via the ballot box. For partisan reasons, as we are seeing now, impeachment may not be practical. That leaves us with just one way.

If a president cannot be indicted of crime while president, then the facts surrounding the alleged crime must at least be available to the general public so that they are well-informed when they go to the ballot box. The president may then defend himself in the political arena in front of the court of public opinion.
Comment (8): I would add that the DOJ needs to be in a silo, shielded from the White House.  The AG should not be permitted to serve as the president's personal counsel.   And while we're at it, let's change that DOJ guideline about not indicting the president for felonies.
Comment (9): The executive privilege argument has historically failed in impeachment, as it leads to an Article of Impeachment: Contempt of Congress. Basically an analogy to obstruction of justice. But this case will be very difficult anyway, as the witnesses have described, very clearly, a treasonous bribe, and bribery and treason are each explicitly enumerated offenses that justify impeachment and removal from office.
Comment (10): "The President and his associates abused their power.  We are going to indict him."

*You can't indict a sitting President.  The only recourse is impeachment.*

"Ok, we'll impeach him.  Now give us the witnesses."

*You can't subpoena witnesses who work for the President.*

"So how can can we conduct the impeachment?"

*You need first-hand witnesses.*

"Fine, hand them over."

*No*
Comment (11): "Executive privilege" shouldnt exist.
Fixed it.
Comment (12): It doesn't. You guys are letting it. Get over the "oh I don't want to look political," and do your damn jobs.
Comment (13): In fact, Impeachment is the REMEDY to the claim of executive 'privilege'...
Comment (14): Impeachment should cut through the president's defenses like a soft cheese.
Comment (15): It doesn’t. Dump and his crew of ass kissers just have no problem with fucking over the law and the constitution every fucking moment of every fucking day.
Comment (16): Executive Privilege is a bullshit concept constructed by big-government Republicans (and Democrats, if we're honest) that exists only to allow the Executive to break the law under the cover of "national security." Almost every nasty, criminal, and outright morally abhorrent action taken by our government has been cloaked in Executive Privilege.
Comment (17): You could take the last six words out of that headline and be basically correct.
Comment (18): Well no shit. 

That’s *the point* of a formal investigation
Comment (19): I mean well a judge is saying that you have to comply
Comment (20): Did that even need to be said? Oh wait, I forgot the identity of the current White House resident.
Comment (21): Duh.
Comment (22): Executive privilege was never intended to be used to obstruct justice.  It was to help a president govern, not to help a mob boss escape justice.
Comment (23): Exactly and seeing how impeachment has become the only way to keep a president held to account, it's even more critical that the president can't impede it in anyway.
Comment (24): I wish that in the face of this, all of America was brave enough to just stop showing up to their own court dates in protest...  Just like the president does. 

And while they’re at it, if only everyone in America could be organized enough to just claim 25 dependents on their tax returns to pay nothing until Trump releases his returns and submits to a public audit.  Storm 2020 Tax Returns—They Can’t Audit Us All!
Comment (25): You also shouldn’t be able to preemptively use executive privilege based on the assumption that the president might want to exert it later.
Comment (26): It doesn't. If it did then the branches wouldn't be equal.
Comment (27): It’s a “privilege” not a right
Comment (28): >Executive Privilege Should Have No Power When It Comes to an Impeachment

It doesn't
Comment (29): Executive privilege should be withheld for impeachment purposes and in any case where there is suspicion of criminal conduct.

So basically for Trump's entire Presidency.
Comment (30): he tried executive privilege, he tried absolute immunity (which is simply not a thing), he's just throwing shit at the supreme court to see what sticks.
Comment (31): Chief Justice Roberts may decide on "executive privilege" in real-time during the trial in the Senate. I expect Bolton to testify there.
Comment (32): YouTube and Facebook should have no power to censor the name Eric Ciaramella but here we are. Our human rights are being stripped away by evil corporations and the Governments sits there and gives them immunity from prosecution as a neutral publisher. The Constitution has been trampled upon I demand that my human rights be restored. Executive privilige applies to impeachment.
Comment (33): Truth should have no place in an impeachment hearing

SUBMISSION (8): Trump tells Louisiana being ranked 50 in economic development is "fine." Twitter reminds him of the number of states

Comment (1): As someone who lives in the hell hole that is Louisiana, I can tell you, our 50th ranked economy isn't "fine"...The fact that most Louisianians gobble Trump's shit up with a grin on their face is pretty good evidence why we're 50th though...
Comment (2): Louisiana has the potential for greater economic growth, but local politicians give unheard of subsidies to oil and gas companies. This is an interesting video that breaks some of it down; https://youtu.be/RWTic9btP38
Comment (3): The comment is not really a reflection of his ignorance (although he is), but rather a reflection of his disregard for the truth.

He started by saying the state's economy was "lousy" before quickly changing to his tune, because the former highlights how little his tenure has actually done to improve the economic conditions of a pro-Trump state despite his constant boast of economic success. His messaging is caught between urging people to be content with his own supposed achievements (for the general election), and propagating discontent with the incumbent Democrat governor (for the gubernatorial race).

In the end, he forgot why he was at the rally and decided self-promotion was more important.
Comment (4): The reddest states in this country are the poorest, least healthy and least educated. Yet they keep voting for the party that keeps them down.
Comment (5): Trump doesn't care about your economic conditions as long as you keep voting Racist Red.
Comment (6): "But we're doing great in Arkansas. Recently, we've risen to 46th in the prevention of Rickets, and 49th for people crushed by Heavy Stones. Watch out Alabama, we're coming for you!"

(from memory, that was Phil Hartman as Bill Clinton from the 92 debates)
Comment (7): Trump loves the poorly educated.
Comment (8): In Trump's mind, being the worst is completely the same as being the best. And if that doesn't work, it don't matter. Just juggle with numbers and words. Nobody cares, because everyone is dumber then Trump. He's the bigliest genius, many people have told him that. Even big guys! With tears in their eyes, like they usually have while having a conversation with Trump about Trump being a very awesome Trump
Comment (9): He called John Bel Edwards a radical leftist. Jesus fuck. In what world?

If Republicans are going to call you socialists or leftists even when you're Republican-lite and trying to compromise, you might as well just be what they say you are. They don't operate in good faith. Everyone needs to stop trying to compromise with them.
Comment (10): Just another state this snake oil salesman would have never set foot in if not for political gain.

Winning!

Absolute degenerate.
Comment (11): He's basically saying to his Louisiana supporters, "I'm not going to do anything to improve your economic lively hood.

Durrrr..."hE teLLs iT LiKe iT iS!"
Comment (12): This is the entire South- last in everything except hatred and projection.
Comment (13): If you look at the states that are most Trumpian, they are the poorest, least educated, poor healthcare, and most dependent of the federal government for welfare sending as a percentage of state GDP.

Trump knows that if he gives them fear, hate, resentment and racism, they will follow him.
Comment (14): The richest zipcode in Louisiana is also the poorest. 
The reason is tax exemptions for industry. There is a excellent presentation on YouTube called ,"Why Louisiana stays poor", that is excellent and really explains, why the things are the way they are.  The whole state has been bought off by Petro dollars.  

Baton Rouge is known as the Chemical City. All up and down the river there are chemical plants and refineries. The only industries in Louisiana are Petroleum and sugar . Tourism is important as well but the money comes from oil and sugar. Any attempt to force industry to pay more taxes ,and they will say, lay off 500 people or they stop some science program they were funding in the school. It's a shame.  

We have to fix this shit or we are fucked.
Comment (15): In Trump's world, winners and losers have zero to do with reality, and everything to do with what he can scam out of them.
Comment (16): Desperation makes people vote for the strong man
Comment (17): I saw abject poverty in Florida, I can’t imagine what it looks like in Louisiana
Comment (18): Trump is a good example of overconfidence meeting age-related dementia.
Comment (19): Louisiana is proof that the Republican brand of capitalism is a failure.
Comment (20): Surprised WV is at the bottom for this.
Comment (21): Maybe he thinks since 50 is a bigger number than 1... you can see where I'm going with this, right?
Comment (22): Seems like the whole thing is just more Trump word salad:

> "A vote for John Bel Edwards,"—the Democratic incumbent in the  race—"is a vote for radical leftists who despite your values, hate your  beliefs and want to crush the workers of the state," Trump said.  
>  
>"You're doing lousy," Trump said, before quickly deciding to change tack and justify his remarks. "Compared to others," he said.  
>  
>"Look,  the whole country's doing great. We're having a great, great surge like  we've never had in the history. Our country is the strongest it's ever  been... but you're ranked 50 in economic development. So you're doing  fine but you're not doing like you should be doing."

He doesn't even go 3 sentences before he contradicts himself...
Comment (23): Takes a special type of place to be beat by Kansas.
Comment (24): 50th? That's halfway to the top right! Way to go Louisiana!

-The Donald
Comment (25): His mouth breathing followers wouldn’t pick up on this.
Comment (26): When you can’t even say “Thank god for Mississippi” you know things are bad. 

But at least they’re number 1 in beating Bama and for that we’re thankful
Comment (27): Trump won’t do anything to help Louisiana because he can win the state regardless. All he has to do is hold a rally and say some words. That’s how dumb people are.

Local politicians won’t do anything either because corporations own them. The state has negative population growth, people are fleeing the state. It’s terrible to live there because of the economic disadvantages enacted by local politicians even though Louisiana is the leader in foreign investment and has an extraordinary wealth of natural resources. Louisiana is the swamp that needs to be drained.
Comment (28): "What do you have to lose?"
Comment (29): Oil spills and Mississippi River flooding - donald has no clue- but unfortunately, some voters will for his agenda.
Comment (30): Can anyone clarify? Mississippi doesn't even have a city! What economy do they have? A University in Tupelo, casinos in Pascagoula and Gulfport, and some contractors in Jackson? How is Louisiana, with at least 3 or 4 actual cities, worse off economically?
Comment (31): \>  In spite of Trump's assertions that Edwards was a "radical leftist," he is in fact one of a few Democrats who does not support impeachment of the president and also signed into statute one of the country's strictest anti-abortion laws—a law nicknamed the Heartbeat Bill which bans abortions once a heartbeat is detectable with no exceptions for rape or incest. 

&#x200B;

what a fucking piece of shit
Comment (32): He just got confused by the number of Oblasts in his fav country so he just blurted this out.
Comment (33): Trump thinks Russia is the 51st state.
Comment (34): Isn’t it 51 since he bought Greenland?
Comment (35): He was thinking in terms of the number of Russian federal subjects.
Comment (36): You don't understand!  It's okay!  Somebody has to be last!

Which funnily enough, is the argument I use with the wife when I wanna be a bit cheeky when she's telling me she picks up more laundry off the floor than I do, or something similar.

The difference is she knows I'm joking and acknowledging that she's right.
Comment (37): "One of these days the people of Lousiana are gonna get good  government, and they arent gonna like it"  They're still waiting Huey....
Comment (38): Could this man be any more stupid? I don't think it's possible.
Comment (39): Hey there, y'all are number 1!  (at being 50th)
Comment (40): "We're number 50!  We're number 50!  Where is number 51? !"

"Oh, right... "
Comment (41): Just to set the record straight---- https://wallethub.com/edu/states-most-least-dependent-on-the-federal-government/2700/
Comment (42): It's not the ranking that matters (somebody's going to be last), it's the disparity between the first and last places.  

And honestly, 'economic development' isn't necessarily something to strive for.  Maybe they *like* a less industrialized society.  

The problem is that 'economic development' is a decent proxy for education, health care, and quality of life, and Louisiana's probably 50th in all of those.
Comment (43): > [You know what I just found out from my father-in-law? That math was created by Muslims. And we teach this Islamic math to children. Math teachers are terrorists! Algebra? More like Al Jazeera. Under a ~~Ryan~~ Trump presidency, I will ban this Sharia math from being taught to American children. There will be no more math.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=embMAtagQiU)

**Taps Head:** You can't be in last if you don't believe in math.

> “No more math! No more math!" (chanting intensifies)
Comment (44): Man that site is horrendous on mobile
Comment (45): Louisiana: the participation trophy state
Comment (46): "Twitter reminds him." I'm so tired of these headlines, and there are two like it—both from Newsweek—on the front page of this sub now. How many people are on Twitter? What percentage of Americans? How representative of the US is Twitter?

Fuck Trump.
Comment (47): it's insane how much of an alternate reality Trump supporters live in, boggles my mind every time I see them speak on TV.
Comment (48): to be fair some state will always have to be 50th.
Comment (49): Someone has to be last
Comment (50): If Republican policies worked why are all these hard red states that have voted to the right for decades so shitty? They are all at or near the bottom in education and economic status.
Comment (51): I despise Donald Trump but this isn’t a gaffe. 

His premise is that the US is the strongest it’s ever been, and his argument is that being last place in a strong country is fine. It’s akin to saying, “Being last place in the US is still better than being first place in any other country, because America is that far ahead of everyone else.”

Obviously his premise is a load of garbage: other countries consistently outrank us in multiple measures and the economy is certainly not the strongest it’s ever been (or even has been in the last 20 years.) But calling him out for not knowing how many states there are is ridiculous, and is not the crux of his BS.
Comment (52): But someone’s got to be 50th! /s

Guarantee you this is the primary defense
Comment (53): I like how when you cross the state line from Texas to LA, the highway roads instantly become shittier.
Comment (54): Hey, if you just turn that frown upside down Louisiana is #1.
Comment (55): Someone has to be dead ass last
Comment (56): Do you know what you call the lowest GPA student who graduates med school? Doctor.

Do you know what you call the 50th economy per state? A state of the United States of God damn America.

This....this is how people in Louisiana will respond to this statement.
Comment (57): Had to move next door to Texas.  Louisiana’s no place to lock my kids into.  It’s just too hard to live there.  Family freaks out like you’re abandoning them.  I told them they were free to pay my bills but they didn’t take me up on the offer.  Spots in Texas (north of Houston for me) are quite open minded.  I couldn’t be happier with the development of my children since we moved. 

Tried not to as mouth it too much.  I wanted better opportunities and they ended up only being six hours away (New Orleans to Houston). Kids are now considering colleges and opportunities around the world.  Family is important but quality of life is as well.....
Comment (58): On one hand, out of 50 states, one of them has to be ranked 50th pretty much 100% of the time, on the other, there’s not really any good reason why even the worst state in the nation shouldn’t be a fantastic place to live.
Comment (59): Someone needs to be in last place
Comment (60): Throw Mississippi, Alabama, in there as well. Never quite recovered from not being able to take advantage of slave labor. Too damn lazy to do the work themselves.
Comment (61): Know who is not 50th? Blue states.
Comment (62): 57 states according to obama
Comment (63): Obama said there was fifty-seven.  Of course, that was a lie, but I bet this clown will use that number from Obama since it sounds less worse.
Comment (64): It's 50th best.  That sounds pretty good to me.  If you ate at the 50th best restaurant in the world, you'd get a damn good meal.
Comment (65): Meh, this is neither here nor there.

Mathematically one state has to be the last one.

Even if all 50 states are doing amazing (which they are not) in economic development, there will be a state that ranks in the 50th spot.

We need to evaluate economic development using objective, not by relative comparison.

Comment (4): This is their entire mission:  https://gawker.com/5814150/roger-ailes-secret-nixon-era-blueprint-for-fox-news

> Republican media strategist Roger Ailes launched Fox News Channel in 1996, ostensibly as a "fair and balanced" counterpoint to what he regarded as the liberal establishment media. But according to a remarkable document buried deep within the Richard Nixon Presidential Library, the intellectual forerunner for Fox News was a nakedly partisan 1970 plot by Ailes and other Nixon aides to **circumvent the "prejudices of network news" and deliver "pro-administration" stories to heartland television**** viewers.**

> The memo—called, simply enough, **"A Plan For Putting the GOP on TV News"**— is included in a 318-page cache of documents detailing Ailes' work for both the Nixon and George H.W. Bush administrations that we obtained from the Nixon and Bush presidential libraries. Through his firms REA Productions and Ailes Communications, Inc., Ailes served as paid consultant to both presidents in the 1970s and 1990s, offering detailed and shrewd advice ranging from what ties to wear to how to keep the pressure up on Saddam Hussein in the run-up to the first Gulf War.

So it is no surprise if his servants, also, disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. Their end will correspond to their deeds.

Comment (9): I'm confused. God told Paula White a secret. It's a really important secret...it's something we all need to know. God also told Paula White to charge me (and others) $229 for this urgently important secret information.

Here's the confusing part: what is it about Paula White that caused God to choose her as the Secret Point Person  instead of say...me? Or you? I'd rather it be me, though...

...because even just 1,000 secret-seekers puts $229,000 in my checking account. With $229,000, I can spend more time talking to God who will probably tell me more secrets (I did such a great job with the first one) and then I can share those new secrets for $229 (each). It's a win/win!

(It's not a win/win if Paula White is involved. God made a rare mistake in choosing her as the Secret Point Person. How do I know? God told me. Yeah, we talk all the time and he's not a Paula White fan. That's the real secret, and for $229, I'll send you the details.)
Comment (10): A fool and his money are soon parted.
Comment (11): That woman has found the right organisation to work for.
Comment (12): Hell, I'll sell it to you for only $199.
Comment (13): So a grifter president hires a grifter religious nutjob as spiritual advisor. I will bet trump gets a huge kickback from anything she brings in and that's the only reason she's there.
Comment (14): This is what you are up against, and you know these folks can't write the check fast enough.  Anyone that thinks that logic and common sense will appeal to these people and make things right- I have bad news for you.
Comment (15): This entire administration is one big phishing email forwarded by your grandparents.
Comment (16): Darwin on a financial level, I guess...
Comment (17): Spoiler: First instruction will be to give her more money.
Comment (18): >numbers are important to God

Toxic Evangelism
Comment (19): And if you call now, I'll throw in miracle spring water!
Comment (20): Years ago there was a prominent late night evangelist who lost most of his followers when a TV investigation discovered the garbage bin behind HQ was filled with envelopes and their contents. Only the money had been removed.

This was around the time of Jim and Tammy Faye.

Can't remember his name - wasn't worth taking up space in my brain - but, if you Google 'farting preacher', you will find him soon enough.

Someone should give her the same treatment.
Comment (21): Fuck her. Fuck all predatory "pastors". Fuck her, fuck her, fuck her.
Comment (22): Trump is surrounded by despicable people who are just like him.
Comment (23): We have a game show host for our President, this can't   come as a surprise
Comment (24): Only fucking morons believe this shit
Comment (25): Anybody who believes a word that comes out of this woman's mouth is an idiot, full stop
Comment (26): Hmmm, does the Bible have anything to say about this? 1 Timothy deals with leadership qualifications, how to treat widows, and how to treat money amongst other things. Chapter 6, starting halfway through verse 2, bolding the relevant parts:

"These are the things you are to teach and insist on. 3 If anyone teaches otherwise and does not agree to the sound instruction of our Lord Jesus Christ and to godly teaching, 4 they are conceited and understand nothing. **They have an unhealthy interest in controversies and quarrels about words that result in envy, strife, malicious talk, evil suspicions** 5 and constant friction between people of corrupt mind, **who have been robbed of the truth and who think that godliness is a means to financial gain.**

6 But godliness with contentment is great gain. 7 For we brought nothing into the world, and we can take nothing out of it. 8 But if we have food and clothing, we will be content with that. 9 Those who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction. 10 **For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil.** Some people, eager for money, have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs."

Make no mistake here, the New Testament is not shy about calling wealth, money, etc, and this is just a single instance of that. And this kind of douchbaggery was specifically why Jesus came in the first place- to eliminate the "middle men" in a spiritual relationship, because too many people back then were using religion to fleece the masses.
Comment (27): This is heresy. Period.
Comment (28): I went to Pigeon Forge and Gatlinburg, TN this summer.  They're tourist trap cities where everything feels cheap, glitzy, and designed for entertainment, the sort of thing 10-year-old me would have liked but adult me thinks is dumb.

Trump and his ilk are cut from this cloth.
Comment (29): She's married to the keyboardist from Journey.

White House party crasher Michaele Salahi is married to Journey guitarist Neal Schon.

What is it with Journey and White House grifters?
Comment (30): The de-legitimizing of evangelical Christianity continues...
Comment (31): Sad because the people who would give the 229 I'm sure can't afford to.  As much as we hate on the Trump crowd you have to acknowledge at the end of the day they're getting scammed and that's sad.
Comment (32): Is she going to be the one to tell them to do the civil war thing? Apparently nothing would shock me now.
Comment (33): There are no more deserving people to get scammed.
Comment (34): Bet Trump didn't have to pay.
Comment (35): If I was Pastor to a known criminal, traitor, pedophile who managed to avoid prison AND become President by betraying America to her adversaries... I'd be grifting magic too.

You can't explain that.
Comment (36): “Jesus he knows me, and he knows I’m right.” - Phil Collins (Genesis)
Comment (37): >In order to receive White's instructions on defeating enemies, the televangelist asks followers to pay $229, which she says is "in accordance with" 1 Chronicles 22:9 in the Bible. The verse speaks about peace and rest from enemies.
"It is a specific seed, numbers are important to God," says the email.

So why doesn't $2.29 work?
Comment (38): Why do I get the feeling the prophetic instructions are going to be on the level of Dark Souls messages? TRY FIRE.
Comment (39): This puts a bad taste to my mouth. So much for separating state and church.
Comment (40): I have several religious family members who will vote for The Orange because he upholds their views on abortion.  

I just can't understand supporting this guy for any reason.  He's not Christian, he's not moral, he's not a good person in any aspect.

SMH
Comment (41): This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-pastor-paula-white-prophetic-instruction-defeat-enemies-1471978) reduced by 73%. (I'm a bot)
*****
> President Donald Trump&#039;s personal pastor and spiritual advisor Paula White is asking followers to give her $229 in order to receive &quot;Prophetic instruction&quot; on how to defeat the enemies in their lives this November.

> The request for money in exchange for this so-called prophetic instruction comes just two weeks after the Trump administration appointed White to head up the White House&#039;s new Faith & Opportunity Initiative, which was founded by executive order last year.

> &quot;But I believe that God was very clear when I received this word that the $229 seed given in faith can break any chains,&quot; the email adds, again urging people to pay the full $229. White tells believers that in exchange for their money they will receive a &quot;Teaching series&quot; on how to defeat their enemies.

Comment (42): Ah some run of the mill grifting and snake oil peddling.  I longed for those days.
Comment (43): If you give your money to a vile creature like that, you deserve to go to hell.
Comment (44): Grifter in chief.
Comment (45): I swear these villains have never heard of the _New Testament_.
Comment (46): Why specifically $229?
Comment (47): Just as Jesus preached: "Hate thy enemies, and scheme against them so that you may win."
Comment (48): Would be interesting to see how she did the cost analysis to come up with that specific amount.  Other than "what's the most I can ask without looking totally stupid..."
Comment (49): Ain’t religion great
Comment (50): These people worship something for sure- but it ain't Jesus Christ.
Comment (51): Seed faith great.
Comment (52): "Enemies" and "warfare".  Is that how we should view evangelizers who ignore our no religion signs and knock on our front doors?  Who now have infected ER rooms of hospitals and try to "save us" when we're in acute pain?  

It is said freedom of speech cannot exist without responsibility.  We need congress to step up to the plate and regulate such hate and warfare speech.
Comment (53): Mammon-mia... this is about as far from Christ-like as one could get.
Comment (54): I never thought I’d see the religious right rise back up to the political power they had in the 80s and early 90s.
Comment (55): Paula White and Donald Trump certainly fit the old adage "birds of a feather flock together."

Con artists of America Unite!  Soon I expect the Trump campaign will announce that if you donate enough cash it will guarantee your spot in Heaven or some other such blasphemy that is now known as conservative politics in America.
Comment (56): I seem to have missed the part of the Bible where Jesus instructed his followers to fork over cash for tips on how to defeat their enemies.  Was that before he declared that he came to provide mercy to sinners or after he extolled his followers to offer their other cheek to someone who slaps them?
Comment (57): Everybody in this government can go fuck themselves
Comment (58): From approximately 2001 to 2008, my wife was the lead video editor on White's televangelist show.  She was brought in from outside the church; her purpose was to give the show a more secular look and feel than other televangelists at the time - trying to mimic Oprah and capitalize on her show's popularity.   

After her divorce from Randy White in 2007, the show rapidly lost popularity and most of the staff were laid off.  The show resorted to mostly airing reruns, the production department was closed down, and my wife worked from home office for about a year then was eventually let go.  Fun side note: you can't collect unemployment if you were fired from a church that doesn't pay taxes.  

She's told me stories about the times trump appeared on the show.  On one hand, I wish she had kept some of that unedited footage.  On the other hand, I don't want my wife to get accidentally epstein'd so maybe it's good that all that is a decade behind us.  

Seeing White pop back up in the daily news cycle makes us both nauseated.  LPT: don't work for a televangelist unless you're already completely indoctrinated.
Comment (59): If you act now, you'll get a free Jesus medallion. Yes that's right! If you order in the next 5 minutes you'll get a free Jesus medallion!
Comment (60): Get this fraud off the streets and begin the long process of reeducating her.
Comment (61): This woman is who Jesus would be beating down on the steps of the temple. She is a breathing corruption.
Comment (62): Dont forget.  It's almost the new year.  You must send her your first paycheck so you can collect your reward later on.  And no it's not a ponzi scheme cuz that would be wrong.

You must send your first paycheck or suffer the "consequences".
Comment (63): I thought Christians were supposed to accept their enemies and turn the other cheek; dude wasn't about winning anything on this world.
Comment (64): The instructions will come as a private video to the buyer!  

But the video will be of Paula White speaking in "tongues".

The separate .PDF translation will be another $99.
Comment (65): [Pat Bagley, The Salt Lake Tribune](https://i.imgur.com/Z7pKWVP.jpg)
Comment (66): She is the religious counterpart of Trump - a master con artist and grifter who never misses a chance to fleece others. No wonder Trump admires her. I pity the marks who fall for her con.
Comment (67): That should be illegal. It probably is, but nobody Is stopping her.
Comment (68): John 2:13-16

13 When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, Jesus went up to Jerusalem. 14 In the temple courts he found people selling cattle, sheep and doves, and others sitting at tables exchanging money. 15 So he made a whip out of cords, and drove all from the temple courts, both sheep and cattle; he scattered the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables. 16 To those who sold doves he said, “Get these out of here! Stop turning my Father’s house into a market!”
Comment (69): Damn the price of being Religious is going up!. There is free shipping though! That's a plus!
Comment (70): “Defeat their enemies”? What is this feudal Europe?
Comment (71): 2019 snake oil salesman or saleswoman. Literally with the anointing oil.

How do ppl fall for this stuff.
Comment (72): The right are just scam artists scamming the most gullible in the country.
Comment (73): >Trump ChINO Pastor

Step 1: Tell a lot of people to give you two hundred and thirty bucks each.
Comment (74): Why such a random amount tho, $229?
Comment (75): This is why I can’t stand when my fellow Christians talk about Trump being Christian. This is straight up heresy and what they teach about the Bible, Jesus, and Christian life is reprehensible. 

Theologically, there is no leg for them to stand on.
Comment (76): Why isn't she in prison?
Comment (77): As a real Christian, this is disturbing for more than just her use of the name of God to make money. She's actually placing all us Real Christian on the side of the enemies. 

Satan's Christians grow bold and lie to lay claim to the name, and they claim to speak for the word of God. 

They don't.
Comment (78): Trump’s latest low-information dick ornament?
Comment (79): really? my smiting has been kind of falling off lately...
Comment (80): What a bunch of bullshit.
Comment (81): I think God meant Shekels not Dollars.
Comment (82): Step 1: Get gullible rubes to give you money for nothing.
Step 2: Repeat.
Comment (83): They know their audience.
Comment (84): Give just $25 and we will have the Pastafarian Sector of the Holy Pizza dish up the Supreme All Topping Pizza of Exorcism, just for the restitution of her moral character.
Comment (85): Do you know if there will be a Black Friday sale?

I want instructions on how to defeat Paula White.
Comment (86): I will go a gladly deliver the same results for $199.
Comment (87): I wonder how much it'll set me back to have God give Trump and Pence simultaneous heart attacks.
Comment (88): Wonder if donations are supposed to be sent to a White House address?
Comment (89): There's a stable genius born every minute.
Comment (90): And this is part of the teachings of the Bible and Jesus !??!?!?

Wasn't their something in the Bible about FALSE PROPHETS?
Comment (91): As Jesus said...*"Give me money and I'll fuck your enemy's face up, yo!"*
Comment (92): I truly hope there is a God to give scammers like her the punishment they deserve.
Comment (93): I'll do it for ten bucks.
Comment (94): Wow. These “Christians” are very malicious.
Comment (95): 1 Timothy 2:12       
And I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man, but to be in silence.
Comment (96): Or buy a bullet for pennies.
Comment (97): I’ll accept Platinum donations to receive prophetic instructions on how to counter their prophetic instructions
Comment (98): Funny amount!
Comment (99): How to defeat your enemies: Convince them to send you $229 in return for nothing of value.
Comment (100): I wish I was Christian because then when I went to church I could learn a lot from their core tenet of defeating enemies.
Comment (101): Or you could pay $199.99 for discounted prophetic instructions, what I like to call our “Pathetic Instructions” package.
Comment (102): Mind boggles...

... still boggling...
Comment (103): A woman pastor?

Tell me again why evangelicals like this guy?
Comment (104): Ah yes preaching the part of the Bible where it talks about DESTROYING YOUR ENEMIES
Comment (105): Snake oil sales seem to be intensifying.
Comment (106): I saw her book on my grandfather-in-law's table when we went to visit the other day. Financially, he's doing just fine, but I'm hoping he isn't sending her any money all the same.
Comment (107): I defeat my enemies by attacking their weak points for massive damage!!
Comment (108): Says the snake in the garden of Eden.

Comment (115): This whole sheperd fleecing its flock thing plays out daily
Comment (116): No shame...
Comment (117): I wonder if we'll ever get to the point where a majority of this nation comes together to recognize that we have a non-trivial amount of very uneducated, very easily manipulated religious fanatics in this country that follow these people. 

If they weren't actively trying to interject themselves into government, it wouldn't be anywhere near as much of a problem.
Comment (118): By law, her church's tax-exempt status should be revoked.  But Republicans don't care about laws when it comes to one of their own.
Comment (119): This is not just a trump thing sadly. People like Joel olestein and company built their kingdoms on the Evangelical notion of tithing and thus being blessed.
Comment (120): Con-game evangelists make me feel conflicted. On one hand, they are immoral sleaze artists who lie to steal money from embarrassingly stupid rubes. On the other hand, the rubes are so fucking embarrassingly stupid as well as arrogant as they are being fleeced that they damn well deserve to be taken for every penny.
Comment (121): EVERYTHING this god damned administration does is a scam to manipulate dumb people. Gutting education to create more dumb people as we speak unfortunately
Comment (122): Give me money I give you God. 

Give me money I will tell you how to defeat satin. 

Can I give money for the poor and homeless. 

Get the fuck out of here loser.
Comment (123): Human beings don't really change over time. Our fetishism has just evolved from totems to paper bills.
Comment (124): There is a grifters only policy in the whitehouse.
Comment (125): Honestly, I love this.  

>In order to receive White's instructions on defeating enemies, the televangelist asks followers to pay $229, which she says is "in accordance with" 1 Chronicles 22:9 in the Bible. The verse speaks about peace and rest from enemies.

> "But I believe that God was very clear when I received this word that the $229 seed given in faith can break any chains," the email adds, again urging people to pay the full $229. 

How can anyone not love this? It's hilarious. God wants $229 because he's apparently a numerologist. But he'll take $31 too...although really he wants the $229. lol
Comment (126): Disgusting
Comment (127): The Prosperity Gospel worms its way into the White House.

Comment (131): 1: convince suckers to give you money for prophecy
Comment (132): Cool, a real witch finally.
Comment (133): 229 is a good number.  Reminds me of a time years ago in Thailand that a Monk told my wife that she needed to set 225 fishes free that day.   Being serious about such things she asked me to procure the fish from some ladies selling live fish at the local market in Kabin.   I bought all the little fish, then had to buy increasingly larger fish to make the 225 number.   

The problem?  I was expected to haul the fish down a concrete set of steps, several hundred long, to the river (this was not rainy season so the river was low).   Long story short - I hauled she prayed - the guys fishing a few dozen yards downstream seemed pleased.   The moral?  Don’t knock it until you’ve tried it!   Sabai sabai y’all.
Comment (134): Can we stop with the Newweek links? Their website barely works on a fullfledged desktop and is completely nonfunctional on a mobile device.

Comment (1): TL;DR: WH claimed in their public readout for the 4/21 call that Trump discussed Ukraine corruption, with the implication that the July 25th discussion is a follow-up being taken out of context. Now that the memcon of the first call is out, we can see that it was never discussed. So, not only does that not help when it comes to the July 25th call, it exposes that they've misrepresented the call.
Comment (2): So the original summary of the call is completely fraudulent or the new summary of the call is completely fraudulent. 

Did I say "or"? My bad; it's almost certainly "and".
Comment (3): >Nowhere does Trump mention efforts to address Ukrainian corruption, economic prosperity, or democratic institutions. Nor does he even allude to its efforts to beat back the Russian occupation of the Ukrainian territory of Crimea.
Comment (4): Trump makes one illegal blunder, tries to cover it up and makes 2 blunders. Now there are 3 blunders to cover. Then for each blunder there are more cover-ups and more blunders. 

This administration is a giant ball of horseshit snowballing down with no end in sight.
Comment (5): Imagine how different things would be today if Trump could have put on the pretense of cracking down on corruption in both of these calls to Ukraine. Don't mention Biden, don't mention the Crowdstrike nonsense, just Trump giving boilerplate statements to the Ukranian president about the importance of rooting out corruption. It could have been made very clear through other channels that this meant ginning up a public accusation against Biden. But nope, that would have taken more than five minutes of effort, and Trump gets bored easily.
Comment (6): Imagine believing the originally released memo was actually a transcript.
Comment (7): So, hang on. The first memo contained evidence of crimes. The GOP constantly pointed at it and said "see? No crimes!" even though it demonstrated that Trump extorted Zelensky. 

OK. But that memo was fraudulent? Why would the White House release a *fake memo that still contains evidence of a crime?*

Unless the *actual* crime was much worse.
Comment (8): These people are going to get themselves impeached. It is hilarious to watch, but also very sad.
Comment (9): This WH is so stupid. Let's release a memo. But that backfired. 

So let's release another one that still makes us look bad.
Comment (10): ....Now back to the impeachment hearings.
Comment (11): >That transcript shows Trump congratulating Zelensky on his recent election win, promising to arrange a White House visit for the new Ukrainian president, and ***recounting the large number of Ukrainaian women who participated in Trump’s Miss Universe competitions.***

"How can this call be more about me?" ~ Trump
Comment (12): The sole purpose of releasing this first call is *purely* to muddy the waters and get people to think that's the call that launched the inquiry. It's solely disinformation for anyone just getting acquainted with this scandal now.
Comment (13): What the hell is wrong with these media organizations that continually use the word "transcript"?  The WH has never released a transcript; they have only released a summary.  Continually repeating the falsehood that a "transcript" plays right into the WH's hands.
Comment (14): Do not lose focus of the second call. This transcript is meant to distract, to get people to read it thinking it's the call in question. It's meant to confuse. This needs to be kept simple. Ignore this bait.
Comment (15): Got caught a little bit there
Comment (16): Another interesting point is how the two calls have been classified. The April call is "unclassified" or "for official use only", while the July call is labeled as "secret".
Comment (17): And nobody is really surprised Trump's WH would publish a false report. Laws mean nothing to them.

Now, which version sounds more like Trump?

(A)
>Trump “underscored the unwavering support of the United States for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity—within its internationally recognized borders—and expressed his commitment to work together with President-elect Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian people to implement reforms that strengthen democracy, increase prosperity, and root out corruption.”

or (B)
>transcript shows Trump congratulating Zelensky on his recent election win, promising to arrange a White House visit for the new Ukrainian president, and recounting the large number of Ukrainaian women who participated in Trump’s Miss Universe competitions.
Comment (18): It's like the Trump administration is always living in that moment in an episode of *Fraiser* where all the escalating lies that have been told are about to bury Niles.
Comment (19): So the word transcript is used frequently and it was really just a summary of the phone call.  Is it a real transcript or another summary?  

What the hell are all the children learning with all of this nonsense in our government?  What a shame!
Comment (20): See this summary is more believable anyway. Bringing up the Ukraine women in the miss Universe pageant is much more believable than him bringing up corruption.
Comment (21): > That transcript shows Trump congratulating Zelensky on his recent election win, promising to arrange a White House visit for the new Ukrainian president, and **recounting the large number of Ukrainaian women who participated in Trump’s Miss Universe competitions.**

Our tiny-hands leader. What a douche.
Comment (22): You mean Barr lied for him again with another fake summary of Dumps wrongdoings. Surprised, not surprised. What’s got me is that the attorney general keeps getting off Scott free for lying for him.
Comment (23): Fuck this timeline's constant lies.
Comment (24): Of course they did.  Trump and this White House ALWAYS pulls shit out of it's ass.

Comment (25): "The release of the transcript of President Donald Trump’s first call in April with Ukrainain president-elect Volodomyr Zelensky was meant to bolster the case that Trump had nothing but good intentions in his dealings with Ukraine—but it also showed a White House summary of the same call released to the public shortly after it occurred was largely fabricated. "

Again, not a transcript (which is a verbatim written record) but a memo summarizing the call. Anyway let's continue.

Trump claimed the call “underscored the unwavering support of the United States for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity—within its internationally recognized borders—and expressed his commitment to work together with President-elect Zelensky and the Ukrainian people to implement reforms that strengthen democracy, increase prosperity, and root out corruption.”

But such statements are nowhere to be found in the transcript of the call released by the president today.

"Nowhere does Trump mention efforts to address Ukrainian corruption, economic prosperity, or democratic institutions. Nor does he even allude to its efforts to beat back the Russian occupation of the Ukrainian territory of Crimea."

Trump doesn't expect people to actually read the conversation-memo. He just wants people to report on his description of the memo.
Comment (26): shocked pikachu has died from exhaustion
Comment (27): Seems like the only reason this transcript was released was because it is 100% a praise toward Trump from the Ukraine President. It is so fucking petty and banal.
Comment (28): Hopefully, someone/government will 'leak' the actual recording someone obviously made.
Comment (29): Can someone tell me if i'm misunderstanding what's just happened?

The White House released a summary transcript some weeks ago that had words to the effect of "Do me a favor though..."

They have now released the word for word transcript and it says nothing about favors as mentioned in the summary.

So either the summary was wildly inaccurate or this new transcript has parts missing? Is that what's happened?
Comment (30): Question, I would assume the July 25th calls actual transcript on the White House secure server would be some pretty good evidence in this inquiry. Is it impossible to get because of the server it’s on? I’m just curious who has power over that.
Comment (31): You expect us to believe the WH just makes stuff up?
Comment (32): Like anyone with a brain will trust this administration.
Comment (33): Trump lied?!?!

SHOCKER
Comment (34): Wait --- dishonesty from right wing whites?? But he got an evangelical adviser! What did she have to say about lying? Did white Jesus amend the 10 Commandments with an executive order that I missed? Surely the evangelicals that forgave him for rawdogging the porn star as his wife rested from childbirth won't accept NEW sins from their new savior, right??
Comment (35): President Bullshit
Comment (36): The only thing that "transcript" confirmed was that Trump planted the notion that the two should meet. That fact tied with the corroborated allegations that that meeting later had conditions put on to benefit the president personally shows a planned effort at extorting Ukraine.
Comment (37): this will turn into:

trump : "i told you the call was perfect"

reporter " the second call...is..."

trump : "FAKE, FAKE NEWS!"
Comment (38): If this presidency doesn't end in impeachment, America is doomed.
Comment (39): Bet the edits were made with a Sharpie.
Comment (40): I think that releasing the April call was meant as a distraction. But this administration has shot itself in the foot yet again.   


The call provides a clear context to the leverage that Trump had over Zelensky. Zelensky is clearly interested in meeting with Trump and makes the request repeatedly throughout the call. The July call and the behind the scenes negotiations that have been described by multiple witnesses make it clear that not only were the security funds being withheld as leverage, but a meeting with Trump was also on the table in return for a public statement on the investigation into the Bidens and the 2016 election meddling.   


Imagine how this scenario could have played out in a lawful and ethical way for contrast:

The President of the United States expresses concern that the security funds provided by Congress might be misused due to corruption in the Ukrainian government. He temporarily suspends delivery of the funds until he can ensure their proper use. The budget office reports the suspension to Congress with a list of steps it intends to take to ensure the funds are properly dispensed and used. The State Department works with Ukraine to outline concerns and remediation options. As a "payoff" to the Ukrainian administration (quid pro quo) for curtailing corruption Zelensky gets to meet with the President where they will make a joint statement about working together to reduce corruption and ensure the rule of law (without reference to specific investigations, people, or companies). Then the President announces the release of security funds and the approval of anti-tank weapons. 

That scenario could have likely happened very quickly, with little risk, and a win for both countries. Instead it turned into a political shit-show because Trump wanted specific investigations which caused the Ukrainian government to be put in a tough position.
Comment (41): Of course they did.

smh
Comment (42): The square peg that Republicans or white house staff can't put in the round hole of reality, is that Trump thinks what he did (blackmail) is legitimate, because he's done that all through his miserable life.
Comment (43): I feel like we’re about a week away from learning that Trump picked up the phone, screamed “Get me Ukraine!”, then when he was connected yelled “Biden Biden Biden Biden BIDEN!!” and hung up.
Comment (44): THIS IS NOT THE SAME PHONE CALL.

And these are supposed to be journalists?!

Edit: Well I'm confused but def my bad.

Comment (1): I'm beginning to think, just like trump, guiliani has never followed the law.
Comment (2): Lock his sorry ass up.
Comment (3): He's also under national security intelligence investigation.
Comment (4): Federal investigation=DOJ, right?  So Bill Barr, or people reporting to him, investigating Rudy?  Very interesting.  Getting ready to throw Rudy under the bus?
Comment (5): I hope he goes to jail.
Comment (6): But her emails...
Comment (7): Investigate Giuliani? The hell you will! He's got a two-day head start on you, which is more than he needs. Rudy's got friends in every town and village from here to the Sudan. He speaks a dozen languages, knows every local custom. He'll blend in — DISAPPEAR — you'll never see him again. With any luck... he's got the Grail already.

> President Donald Trump&#039;s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani is being probed by federal investigators over possible campaign finance violations, Bloomberg reported on Thursday.

> Three US officials told Bloomberg that investigators are looking at possible campaign finance violations and whether Giuliani failed to register as a foreign agent.

> On Monday, a lawyer for Giuliani&#039;s former associate, businessman Lev Parnas, told The New York Times that he was sent to Ukraine by Giuliani to broker a quid pro quo arrangement with the Ukrainian government so that they would investigate the Bidens.

Comment (9): I want off of this ride
Comment (10): Ghouli Ghouliani.
Comment (11): https://youtu.be/4IrE6FMpai8

Rudy should be investigated for this
Comment (12): Possible?!
Comment (13): "Rudy Guiliani is reportedly under Federal Investigation for definite campaign violations" - better title. Just give him a few minutes, he'll admit it himself in his stereotypical double-speak fashion.
Comment (14): Dude looks like a wax sculpture that's being kept in too warm a room.
Comment (15): Possible? lol
Comment (16): They need to get him on some state level charges too, so Trump's pardon power is rendered pointless.
Comment (17): possible HA HA
Comment (18): Possible?
Comment (19): The only problem i have with this is how long it actually took. Should have investigated YEARS ago.
Comment (20): We used to live in a time wherein if the next personal lawyer to POTUS was under investigation because the previous personal lawyer was serving time for campaign finance violations, it would impact your political career, now it is Friday.
Comment (21): Rudy Colludiani is going down big time.
Comment (22): Why hasn't he been arrested yet?
Comment (23): I get how due process works...I’m just over this bullshit news headline. 

Put these people in federal prison already.
Comment (24): I kind of expected this, being the president's personal lawyer and doing all kinds of stuff he shouldn't of been doing. As in, stuff that isn't just personal for Trump but the entire white house. I don't remember a vote ever being held to let him get back into Politics.
Comment (25): The same federal government of which Trump is the head.
Comment (26): Giuliani? Hardly knew him, he was one of my lawyers for a short time
Comment (27): Rudy needs to be placed In bunk beds with the mafia guys he helped put behind bars
Comment (28): We knew this weeks ago, though, right?
Comment (29): “Possible”?
Comment (30): Trump’s attorneys love federal prison
Comment (31): That idiot has temporarily disappeared.   Houdini act.
Comment (32): I assume that Rudy Giuliani is innocent and this is just another attack on the President by the deep state. Stephan King was setup by the New York Times and deserves his committee assignments back.
Comment (33): I hope his phone has been tapped.  God only knows who he's been colluding with...

Comment (1): > "I accept this because it is true"

Words we're still to hear from the GOP.
Comment (2): > four “small clear baggies”    
>  
> Nevárez is now charged with third-degree felony possession and could face up to **10 years in prison** 

What the fuck?!?  Sending people to prison for a decade because they use drugs is absolutely ridiculous.
Comment (3): >In a statement to the Texas Tribune on Thursday morning,  Nevárez (D - TX) said: “I do not have anyone to blame but myself. I accept this because it is true and it will help me get better.”

Yep, people make mistakes, even politicians.

&#x200B;

>Last week, a referee filed suit claiming that Jim Jordan (R - OH), brushed him off, saying, “Yeah, yeah, we know.” when he told him that Dr. Richard Strauss had masturbated in front of him in the locker room showers. The referee is the second person to claim that he directly reported Strauss’s behavior to Jordan, with the first being a former wrestler.  
>  
>"The idea I’m not going to defend our athletes when they’re being harmed is ridiculous," said Jordan to reporters.

What's ridiculous is Jordan's behavior.
Comment (4): Addiction captures people from all walks of life. At least he has the balls to admit it.
Comment (5): Is it just me or did they purposefully pick the most 'I'm high on cocaine' picture they could find of this guy?
Comment (6): You know where I’m NOT going to put my drugs? In an envelope emblazoned with my letterhead.
Comment (7): Man... wtf is going on with politics down in Texas?
Comment (8): Our entire country is a fucking pathetic joke. we pride ourselves on being free. Yet what you do on your own personal time to your own body is criminalized.

Fuck this.
Comment (9): not even Clay Davis was this stupid
Comment (10): Yeah but he shouldn’t get in any trouble, according to Laura Ingraham’s defense of Trump’s bribery, because he wasn’t doing the cocaine. If anything, it was at most just attempted cocaining.
Comment (11): The part that makes it weird is that he's a Democrat.  Usually the ones committing crimes are the Republicans because they know Republicans dont get consequences.  THIS guy is so screwed.  Democrats get in trouble without doing shit and it takes years (and counting) of pointing out that they didn't do anything but you still get crowds chanting to lock them up.  Having a Democrat commit an actual crime is going to be like Christmas for Republicans. 

I bet you a dollar that this guy gets brought up as an example of why they can't congict Trump.
Comment (12): I wondered who the guys stay awake through all this.
Comment (13): What was his political stance on drugs, prior to this happening?
Comment (14): Well that's disappointing. Fucking idiot
Comment (15): If our tax dollars pay for the cocaine and he uses the cocaine to do more work its fine
Comment (16): LOL, "it's high-grade baking powder!!!".
Comment (17): I can't believe this lawmaker would carry around three bags of cocaine at an airport - the DA.
Comment (18): Are the Cons working for the cartels now too?
Comment (19): Sorry for partying.
Comment (20): Cocaine? What is this? The 80s? This might explain why he jumped Rinaldi. He was suffering from coke rage.
Comment (21): He was probably on the way to the airport public restroom to do some Larry Craig footsie with other Republican anti-gay conservative Christian perverts. These hypocrites believe they are above the law and above the morality they make laws to impose upon us lesser folk.
Comment (22): If we build the wall, which side is this one supposed to be on again?
Comment (23): Everybody doin drugs
Comment (24): Poncho’s name is Poncho
Comment (25): I question the idea that he's truly addicted to coke. As someone who spent years addicted to drugs and surrounded by drug users within a drug culture, people who are addicted don't just drop their drugs. I've seen cocaine users literally scraping random crumbs from the floor after they come down just in the hopes that a line they snort or shoot up could possibly contain traces of coke. No one I knew, including myself, were careless with their drugs - - nothing was more imperative. Furthermore, he dropped what is a very small amount of coke for someone who uses it even on occasion. For a true addict, an eight ball just gets you started
Comment (26): LMG Republican?
Comment (27): I think we should drug test every member of congress and every judge and prosecutor in the country. I'm willing to bet you'd find a sizeable number of them with something illicit in their system.
Comment (28): You knew he was a Democrat when his party wasn’t mentioned in the headline.

Comment (1): The NRA, and the GOP will blame video games as usual while sitting high upon their perch, in their lavish mansions.  Sales are good, nothing else matters.
Comment (2): Can i stop reading articles that are centered around what new hashtag is "trending"?
Comment (3): The nra laundered Russian money for cons, and opposes every attempt at common sense laws.
Comment (4): This just is not human anymore, shooting each other just because you don´t feel good, sadly these things DO happen
Comment (5): Guns don't kill people. People kill people.

We need a better mental health help network and a stronger effort at eliminating the illegal gun trade.

This still would have happened if the NRA didn't exist. You guys gotta stop scapegoating and work on helping people with poor mental health. You can't avoid the mental health problem forever.
Comment (6): This should really wake people up about the mental health issues ripping through our education.. Yes, guns do play a part. But we need to address the roots of this situation -> mental health. 
7/10 college students have some form of depression,  but yet - not many people seem to care. 
Depressed, anxiety, pressure = a person doing things they wouldnt normally do. 
Gun regulation will help. But that will not solve this problem. 
If you want guns taken away, look at what's transpiring in Hong Kong, if the citizens had gun easy accessible the police brutality wouldnt be a thing. And the CCP wouldn't be on the verge of Tiananmen Square 2.0
Comment (7): howmanychildrendidthenrakilltoday.com
Comment (8): The media only cares when rich white kids get hurt but when young black and latino kids die in drug and gang Violence they do not flinch.
Comment (9): California has some of the most strict gun laws....
Comment (10): Never let a tragedy go to waste eh? 

Lets look at the facts: 

Sixteen year old student, not legally eligible to possess a handgun under california law. 

Could not have passed a background check under any circumstances.

Has safe storage laws requiring guns be secured from people who can't legally possess them. 

Could give a rats ass what the NRA thinks and is widely considered the worst state in the nation to be a gun owner because of a stack or control laws five miles deep.

Blaming the NRA for this is ridiculous. California is a gun control affectinado's wet dream. 

Love or hate the NRA but you're just climbing on top of a pile of dead kids to use as a soap box for your political slogan, and worst of all you're helping nobody.

If the strictest gun control laws in the nation didn't prevent a shooting its high time we come to grips with the reality that this is not a problem we can solve through gun control alone and study the fucking problem in order to arrive at a scientifically sound conclusion of what to do about it. 

We see mass killer phenomena in places like Japan and china where guns are generally not available to the public. If someone walks into a kinder garden sprays kerosene all over some kindergartners and sets them on fire does that honestly make you feel better *because they weren't shot?!*

Fuck the NRA, but fuck the gun control crowd too. Y'all are using dead kids to advance your pathetic fucking agenda.
Comment (11): What kind of gun did this kid use? Where did he get it?  Was it reported? I haven't seen any news on it. Also, reminder to everyone; the Virginia Tech Massacre was orchestrated with a .22 caliber pistol and a 9 mm pistol. Two of the smallest caliber and widely available weapons on the market. There are also millions of illegal and untracked pistols and rifles in this country and anyone can get one for a couple hundred bucks without a background check if they just ask the right perspn from the right area. Let's not forget to take these things into consideration when we stand up on our soapboxes and pretend the next gun law that gets passed is actually going to stop school shootings in this country.
Comment (12): How dumb you all are
Comment (13): America, for the sake of your children; you must declare the NRA a terrorist organization

Absolute goddamn monsters.
Comment (14): It’s kind of depressing how it shifted from the war on drugs to... a war on guns. 
To a point that we have a chunk of the population thinking that we should brand a club (that represents a good chunk of Americans and provide safety classes in shooting ranges to a lot of us) A terrorist organization that would then turn every participant into a terrorist. 

Does this feel like justice or democracy to you? doesn’t to me.
Comment (15): Hey, I don't like the NRA, but not every shooting is a fucking mass shooting.
Comment (16): Even universal background check would not have stopped this. The kid used a pistol for crying out loud. Wonder how many warning signs or cracks this kid slipped through before yesterday.
Comment (17): Except it's not, so there's that.
Comment (18): The crowd talking about gun control wouldnt have helped miss the point entirely.  There are MANY situations where gun control would have helped and maybe not all of THIS instance but there are others where it was preventable.  Look at the parkland shooting.  Gun control would have helped there.  Plenty of others in states that DONT have mandatory gun storage laws and shit like this happens. Then theres the fact that we dont know where he got the weapon.
Comment (19): Can someone explain to me the reasoning? California has the strictest gun laws in the nation and the kid wasnt even old enough to legally purchase. How is the NRA to blame? Did one of their reps train the kid then arm him to shoot kids? The logic leaps going on trying to blame anyone or anything except the people actually at fault is astounding.
Comment (20): Gun control you say? That would never work! We shouldn’t even try because you’ll never get your hands on muh guns! What we should do is buy even more guns, and make it even easier to buy guns because then the good guy with a gun can stop a bad guy with a gun. And don’t even bother looking at Canada or Australia as an example of gun control and how many mass shootings they have each year.
Comment (21): They just sent out a four page battle cry letter to anyone who’s a lifetime member calling for more money and to basically rid the world of the liberal heathens that want to take your guns away.  Fake signed by Wayne and all.  What a bunch of garbage
Comment (22): What does the NRA have to do with this shooting? The agency has already been crippled recently.
Comment (23): MassacreMitch
Comment (24): Guns aren’t the problem, people are.
Comment (25): Source on the shooter being an NRA member?
Comment (26): The NRA is solely the voice of its members (they are weaker than most want) a lot of members have not been renewing their memberships, due to the fact that they are rolling over and letting more of the gun rights slip away. I really don’t understand the hatred for an organization that does nothing to commit these crimes and NRA members do not either. The most dangerous thing in this horrible event, where an asshole killed innocent people.....as well as all the others, is the fact that everyone wants to point the finger at the weapon when it was the broken person that committed the crime. There is no outrage for the gang and cartel deaths that happen every day....media does not cover it and neither do the presidential candidates. Over 300 have died in Baltimore this year so far, just one city......all this outrage is pointed at the wrong people, why are these cities that have been democratic run for so long, have so much death? I have left the Democratic Party and I do not like the Republican Party either.
Comment (27): I'm a gun owner and in the military but I am NOT a fan of the NRA. They take money from ANYONE to push the profit of large corps and use the 2nd Amendment as the reason while also using emotion instead of stats to justify their stance. Not cool dudes...

I am not sure what the fix is atm but I think we need to be allowed to conduct studies in gun violence so we can get evidence and use it to make better gun laws. I own quite a few guns and will not give them up. With that said, I do not understand why ANYONE would say that background checks is a bad idea. Or any step forward toward safety is a bad idea.

And for those on both sides that scream "that's not enough so why do it!!!!" Think about it this way. That thinking is like having a leak in your kitchen and not using a bucket to catch the water because it won't stop the leak in your roof. Use the bucket now so it gives you time to find a more permanent solution to fix your leaky roof.

I want to reduce gun violence and maintain a freedom that I have earned in the 2nd amendment. Let's figure this out together without emotion like adults should.
Comment (28): I have always wondered why the NRA *isn’t* considered a terrorist organization.

We live in a country at peace. The organization supports arming the populace and reducing accountability for interpersonal violence. Follows every non-Muslim terrorist event with “More weapons!”

Sounds like a political organization promoting violence to me.
Comment (29): I agree so very much, but on no issue have I received more irrational arguments or downvotes on reddit than gun control. If you think that there are sensible gun control laws they will tell you: oh there’s no way that law can work in the smuggest of fashions. Honestly, people should just not be allowed to arms in homes with children or mentally troubled people.
Comment (30): The only people responsible for murders are the murderers. If you actually think the NRA wants mass murders to happen you’re a special kind of stupid. That’s like an oil company wanting to cause an oil spill, and equally nonsensical. I’m kinda meh on the NRA for not being staunchly 2A enough, they do put profits above our rights, but blaming them for some wacko kid illegally obtaining a gun and shooting up a school is just moronic.
Comment (31): Oh no, whatever will the NRA do with the damage to their reputation?
Comment (32): America. What are you doing.
Comment (33): Not all gun owners are NRA members. There are millions of peaceful gun worshippers sprinkled throughout communities across the United States. Please, let’s not take a small number of Gunians and blame their horrible actions on all Gunians. The NRA Gunians have a perverse interpretation of the constitution but most Gunians believe Gunians and non-Gunians can peacefully coexist.
Comment (34): how bad if it is really true,what happen to the people, they can just be walking around, and shooting somebody,,
Comment (35): They are a terrorist organization that also helped fine foreign money into a presidential campaign. They're more than traitors.
Comment (36): Stop blaming the NRA and start blaming its supporters.
Comment (37): Why not start calling them what they are, Republican Rampages. THere are more than 50 GOP Senators who can oust Mitch right now, and move bills forward. The GOP. Don't. Care.

Comment (1): Trying to intimidate a witness.

This jackass literally can't not break the law
Comment (2): Trump supporters - Honestly, is this how innocent people comport themselves?
Comment (3): Adam Schiff just read it into the record! Hello justice, it's been a while since we've seen you.
Comment (4): >Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad. She started off in Somalia, how did that go? 

I’m assuming this is a Blackhawk Down reference, even though those events occured about 5 years **prior** to her being posted in Somalia.

The movie came out after she left, which is probably proof enough for him that she caused it.
Comment (5): Did he call her ugly and say she wasn't his type yet?
Comment (6): Any guesses on what Trump’s threat “She’s going to go through some things,” actually means? To me, it sounds like something more sinister than getting fired.
Comment (7): "Axios' Alayna Treene reports that Trump's tweet is the type of attack that Republicans told her they were hoping to avoid today." 

Hah...did they really believe that bullshit? Besides, it's a woman who Trump views as going against him, so of course he's going to let out vitriolic vomit.
Comment (8): I thought he was too busy to watch the hearings?
Comment (9): every place my oncologist has worked at has had people die.  He must be terrible!
Comment (10): Of course he couldn't spell "preceding" correctly. But then again, all he really cares about are his personal proceeds.
Comment (11): >...different than **proceeding** administrations.  

If this whole "president" thing doesn't work out, he can always get a job writing craigslist ads.
Comment (12): The Republicans in the committee were laughing about the tweet while it was described as intimidating by the witness.
Comment (13): It was witness intimidation in real time.  Another crime by Trump.  Another impeachable offense.
Comment (14): Oh he’s fine commenting through his safety tweets, what a tool.
Comment (15): So *that's* why Somalia is a shit show! Because Yovanovich was the U.S. Ambassador for a few years!

It all makes sense now; thanks for connecting the dots for us, Trump.
Comment (16): > he [Trump] will be working hard for the American people

Trump "working hard" is a lie.

Trump "working hard for the American people" is so off, it's laughable.

There's not even the smallest grain of truth in the above quote.
Comment (17): this is nauseating to watch, I think this might by the low point of a truly despicably low presidency. It's seriously making me sad....
Comment (18): Wasn't he too busy working to watch it?
Comment (19): We really should be putting our best foreign service agents in those challenging ambassador positions like France, Canada, etc. and not waste them on Somalia and Ukraine.

"This renowned heart surgeon is a joke. Compare the outcomes of her patients to the guy I hired doing lasik in the strip mall."
Comment (20): Trump is an utter coward.
Comment (21): > *Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad. She started off in Somalia, how did that go? Then fast forward to Ukraine,* 

He does realize that the purpose of a US Ambassador its to represent American interests and citizens not solve the host country's problems right?
Comment (22): Trump can’t resist attacking strong women.
Comment (23): She just got through saying the State Department didn't want to issue a statement supporting her because they feared it would be undermined by a Presidential tweet. And immediately a Presidential tweet appears, trying to undermine her. Cassandra much?
Comment (24): If there's one thing innocent people do, it's viciously attack anyone testifying.
Comment (25): Twitter immediately calls a meeting to quickly lower the bar as to what's tolerable on their platform.

"Jack Dorsey - how do we feel about witness tampering?" 

"Who's doing it." 

"Trump"

"Totally fine. Everyone else, unacceptable."
Comment (26): He should try hanging out in Somalia with his fat ass and see how that goes!
Comment (27): Good work by Schiff there. Trump wants to intimidate witnesses in real-time? Call him out in real-time. And (one hopes) add it to the articles of impeachment, because this behavior can’t be allowed to stand.
Comment (28): Intimidation of witnesses
Comment (29): It never fails. Just when I think he can't earn any more disgust from me.. he exceeds all my expectations.
Comment (30): Everywhere she went, went bad???

Like Somalia was just goddamn prefect until **Marie** showed up. And that's literally two countries, the second of which he's responsible for failing relations.
Comment (31): \>  *Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad.*  

Then he names 2 places. Apparently Trump thinks the job of an American ambassador is to run the country they're assigned to.
Comment (32): I guess it's impressive he always finds a new way to be the actual worst.
Comment (33): if Dems are smart they will use to this to get more viewers for the Sondland testimony next week
Comment (34): 'Tis the season to have a reason for treason- fa la la la la la...
Comment (35): What qualifies as a ‘failure’ for being an ambassador in Somalia? The place barely qualifies as a country.
Comment (36): Wow this is a really bad look for Trump.
Comment (37): Witness intimidation.  While she was testifying she felt threatened by Trump.  Classic and grotesque.
Comment (38): Obstruction and witness intimidation in real time.  That's some next-level, 5-dimensional high crimes and misdemeanors.
Comment (39): I thought he wasn't watching these hearings?
Comment (40): What a piece of shit. Witness intimidation while she's giving testimony. 

Trump needs to root in jail until the end of his sorry life.
Comment (41): Multiple House Democrats have said during a break in the hearing that Trump's tweets may trigger an article of impeachment, Axios' Alayna Treene reports.
Comment (42): So much for his lies about not watching the proceedings.
Comment (43): And the Age Of Cowards continues to unfold
Comment (44): He is such a Dumbass wow !
Comment (45): Republicans: Trump said Zelinsky said she was a bad ambassador. So we are supposed to take trumps word. Didnt trump tell him she was bad? so Trump says Trump says shes bad.
Comment (46): Trump commits crimes *so loudly*.
Comment (47): I'm telling ya, Dems need to double dare Trump to testify - he'll be there
Comment (48): So Presidential!
Comment (49): Even though I'm from a brutal dictatorship, I really do feed bad for you Americans. You have a blithering idiot of a "President" who will likely throw your intelligence officers under the bus just for a butt-sex session with Putin.

Comment (54): Much different than **proceeding** administrations?

Did this bozo even go to middle school? It’s **Preceding**, you bent orange shitcan. Preceding.
Comment (55): What a moron. She was a junior foreign service officer in Somalia and he's trying to pin that failed state on her while he takes no credit for any of his litany of failures?
Comment (56): Literal witness tampering in real time.
Comment (57): She was posted there in 1986, her first tour.
Comment (58): Downvoted because Trump wants the slander propagated.
Comment (59): This tweet is certainly a character assassination but how is it witness intimidation?
Comment (60): blames her for Somalia?  that's not even wrong.

Comment (1): Isn't this witness intimidation? While the witness is testifying?
Comment (2): She worked fine under previous republican and Democrat presidents but for some unknown reason couldn’t work under Trump. Hmmm
Comment (3): Witness intimidation.45 is such a crook.
Comment (4): He just... Tweeted it out...
Comment (5): He's blaming her for Somalia?
Comment (6): It's starting to seem like Trump is just helping the Democrats with the investigation.  Like he is just sick and tired of being president, but he's too proud and stupid to resign, so he hopes to be removed.

At least, I hope that's the case.
Comment (7): Cheato is breathtakingly stupid.
Comment (8): It's amazing how fucking stupid Trump truly is...what a fucking moron.
Comment (9): I'm at least glad that all people and historians of the future will easily be able to read just what a pathetic, uneducated, cowardly bully trump is. Like, no one could honestly put his tweets up against the speeches and letters of former presidents and think he stands among them intellectually.
Comment (10): Donny Cheeto Fingers is really in the shit now! He just proved Schiff’s point about witness intimidation by...

INTIMIDATING THE WITNESS VIA TWITTER WHILE SHE WAS LITERALLY TESTIFYING TODAY.

Trump and Co are the dull knives in the drawer.
Comment (11): Trump is simply the canary in the coal mine that is american politics.   It's not just him. The Republicans arent the good guys and trump isnt making it harder for them.  Hes been the perfect scape goat and when this is over he will be richer and americans will think they rooted out all the corruption.  It will set the stage going forward for the republicans to blame trump on all their evil, literally evil ducking policies.
Comment (12): This is an abusive personality. This is what little men do.... When its men testifying "Ham Sandwich" says; I'm too busy. When its a courageous woman, the goal from "Ham" is to immediately make himself feel above her, by means of attempting to insult her. This is what abusive men do, they feel soo little inside they can not help themselves.  EDIT: This is also what criminals do.... attack the reporting of a crime, rather than address the criminal act. When a desperate person has no defense - they always go personal. Add this to an insecure person - and the attacks and insults are usually very telling in that: They reveal what hurts and affects the attacker because they think the same insults hurt and affect the other person.
Comment (13): “Trump blows republicans” is there video proof of this?
Comment (14): When are the Republicans going to realize we have, as Dick Nixon used to say, 'a loose cannon on our deck.'
Comment (15): Only shameless cowards with corruption foaming at their mouthes can carry on shielding a criminal President. 

GOP is a criminal organization and they have a majority in the Senate.
Comment (16): I'm not even a witness — just some dude on the internet — and I feel intimidated.

> If Republicans had one goal going into the House Intelligence Committee&#039;s hearing with former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, it was do not be on the attack.

> Democrats&#039; strategy on Friday hinged on painting Yovanovitch as a &quot;Sympathetic victim of bullying by [Rudy] Giuliani and the president, whose decision to pull her from Ukraine helped set the stage for the campaign to pressure that country&#039;s president,&quot; The New York Times reports.

> For one thing, the tweet made clear that he did in fact single Yovanovitch out - which is exactly what the Democrats&#039; line of question was intended to prove.

Comment (18): Is this why the recess is taking so long?
Comment (19): >Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad. She started off in Somalia, how did that go? Then fast forward to Ukraine, where the new Ukrainian President spoke unfavorably about her in my second phone call with him. It is a U.S. President’s absolute right to appoint ambassadors.

That's not even a legit Trump tweet, that's a Kellyanne/staff tweet. You can tell by the longer sentences, correct capitalization/spelling, and lack of emotional language.
Comment (20): I’ve tried to maintain the belief this guy is not an idiot because he made it to the presidency.  Surely, even with all the help in the world (domestically or foreign), you can’t land the job while being a complete and total idiot. 

Throughout his rhetoric, I’ve always thought it’s all part of a bigger strategy to control the message for his base. It just happens his base loves the propaganda, and his brand is inflammatory. All part of a strategy. 

But this? God damn...dude...
Comment (21): Its getting hot in here.
Comment (22): I like Ken Starr’s comment about the “injurious” tweet. “Sometimes, you have to control your instincts.”  

Huh, almost as if the Republican President is so childlike that you have to explain to him that you can’t just do whatever your impulses tell you.  Maybe that’s a BAD thing in and of itself Ken Starr! Maybe that alone should be disqualifying regardless of whether or not you think his actions are impeachable!
Comment (23): I still think he doesn't want to be president and has been trying to be removed for office the whole time but underestimated just how sheepish the party would be from top to bottom.  

The amount of times he has undermined what Republican plans is to high to be a coincidence anymore right?
Comment (24): >  Trump blows Republicans' entire Yovanovitch hearing strategy with a single tweet


Needs to be corrected to:


>  Trump blows Republicans
Comment (25): Classic Trump.
Comment (26): Predicted Republican talking point:
"It's not witness intimidation because she's not a witness. She's not a witness because this isn't a trial in a US courtroom. "
Comment (27): Smart, patriotic anti-corruption Americans working for the country's best interests...


Of course Republicans go after them.
Comment (28): But but, fox news told me this was boring.
Comment (29): It appears all efforts in the WH to have some sort of review process over Donnie's twitter diarrhea have wonderfully failed...
Comment (30): Trump's tweet was - extraordinarily poor judgment.

Surely not from this president who carefully calculates every step he makes with his in depth knowledge of everything. :p
Comment (31): And they'll continue to ignore it
Comment (32): He blew up one of his own arguments too. The 'transcript' release where Zelenski thanks him for being the "first" person to tell him about the horrible Yavanovitch. He previously said he fired her 'because Zelenski didn't like her'.
Comment (33): and the republicans will all just ignore it.
Comment (34): > What's more, the Democrats' lawyer specifically undercut Trump's line of attack by asking Yovanovitch if anyone in the State Department "ever expressed concern about your job performance," to which the former ambassador answered "no."

The stupid, it burns. Of course his supporters won't hear or care, and that means continued Republican congressional obstruction, distraction, and deception.
Comment (35): I'm just imagining what guys like Jordan and Nunes were thinking when Trump did this

"GODDAMNIT DONALD, NOT NOW!"
Comment (36): The view he has for himself is going to do him in one of these days. What an actual fucking idiot.
Comment (37): Well it’s about time he started blowing them back, I’m sure their knees were getting chafed.
Comment (38): > It is a U.S. President’s absolute right

Ah, yes, how could I forget that he wants to be absolute ruler.
Comment (39): 45 just can't stop talking, can he? His idiocy seems to really help his undoing move along lol.

Comment (1): Fucking scum
Comment (2): Fuck this piece of crap.
Comment (3): In GOP speak: *"Conservative Legal Activist"* is just code for: *"Extremist Right Wing Racist Investor"*
Comment (4): >McConnell is planning to confirm at least 30 more federal judges before the end of the year, Vice reports. The Senate, under McConnell’s leadership, has already confirmed 45 circuit court judges during the Trump administration, quickly closing in on the number of appeals judges confirmed during the eight years of the Obama administration: 55. 

These Federalist Society judges are mostly young, terrifically inept, and will affect the judiciary for 2 generations.


And this is what Mitch McConnell will be known for--ramming through an ungodly number of unqualified judges.
Comment (5): You guys really need to annul Trump's presidency.
These judges are the nazi back office workers a fascist regime needs, and they need to go
Comment (6): The GOP is ensuring permanent future leadership. They cannot govern with a minority unless they pervert the electoral and judicial processes.

> McConnell&#039;s renewed focus on confirming conservative judges comes after his joint fundraising committee received a $256,600 contribution in mid-September from C. Boyden Gray, a George Mason University law professor, founder of Committee of Justice-the &quot;Leading conservative voice on judicial appointments,&quot; according to its website, and a board member at the Federalist Society, an influential conservative legal organization that has groomed many of Trump&#039;s judicial nominees.

> Gray, an heir to the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco fortune and former ambassador to the European Union, has donated millions to Republicans over the years, but his September contribution to McConnell Victory Committee is the largest political donation he has ever given, according to Federal Election Commission records reviewed by Sludge.

> McConnell Victory Committee is a partnership between McConnell&#039;s leadership PAC, re-election campaign committee, and the National Republican Senatorial Committee.

Comment (13): That's the only thing that speeds up the Turtle; money
Comment (14): There has to be a way to undo all his corrupt appointments....
Comment (15): The federalist society needs to be abolished and removed from our politics. All of these judges are hand picked by the crazy fucks!
Comment (16): Maybe we'll get lucky and once a progressive majority happens we'll go ahead and sweep up the garbage conservative judges they are cramming in place because the GOP has been entirely corrupt for decades and we need representation for the people.
Comment (17): "Federal judgeships for sale!  Get 'em while the gettin' is good!"
Comment (18): Totally not tit for tat though because there was no notarized contract stating "this is tit for tat".

&#x200B;

It wasn't constitutional to sell the nation to billionaires until after billionaires already bought the nation.  Conservatism has always been a con by those with wealth to maintain and grow that wealth.
Comment (19): Fuck, fuck, fuck
Comment (20): How many more can there be to confirm? Geez.
Comment (21): Can they be fired or null'd after?
Comment (22): God, they just don't stop. Half the nation hates GOP policy and they feel literally no accountability for those people. Literally not representing 50% of Americans.
Comment (23): is it possible to remove these judges?
Comment (24): Is he adding more judges than available positions or are all these replacements of retiring judges? This is the part I am confused on.
Comment (25): Put more fuel in the chamber and the engine pumps faster
Comment (26): What about not nominating judges so close to the 2020 election?


Checkmate.

Comment (35): The impeachment list grows with each appointment Moscow Mitch.
Comment (36): Poetic Justice = All of Mitch's judges can be easily proven to be "Unwitting agents of a foreign power." and totally impeachable..NOW he has to spend all his political clout on the man  the ruined his legacy..It will make him too weak to win  his Kentucky seat again..

Comment (1): > Donald Trump has been accused of seeking to intimidate a witness, as he launched a scathing attack on Twitter against a US diplomat, even while she testified how she felt threatened by him.
> 
> As Marie Yovanovitch answered questions on Capitol Hill, portraying a devastating image of a state department that had failed to support her in her work and saying she had been threatened by the president’s comments about her to a foreign leader, Mr Trump launched a series of attacks against her on Twitter.

Screenshot of two of Trump's tweets:

>Adam Schiff on Trump's real-time tweet criticizing Yovanovitch.

>"I want to let you know ambassador that some of us here take witness intimidation very, very seriously."

[WaPo On Twitter:](https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/1195371773329641473)

>Schiff: "We saw today witness intimidation in real time by the President of the United States."
Comment (2): The way the Republicans are trying to spin this is insane: "she didn't see the tweet herself so it's obviously not intimidation" absolutely ridiculous.
Comment (3): He *is* intimidating the witness, while she gives testimony. 

He *is* adding his own testimony after denying to participate officially in the process.
Comment (4): If it were anyone else besides trump, I wouldn't believe this is happening in real time.
Comment (5): He's also attacked the anonymous whistleblower multiple times.
Comment (6): Of course the narcissist couldn't stand to have so many people paying attention to someone else, so he did the unthinkable and broke the law in the middle of the hearing, tampering with the witness who was testifying. All the people who are enabling this dangerous lunatic have to know that their careers are effectively over. History will judge them very harshly as the craven cowards that they are. They will go down as the most unpatriotic and un-American people in our history.
Comment (7): Why can't twitter ban him? Seriously if anyone said this they would be banned why does Trump get a free pass to bully, threaten peoples lives on such a public platform!
Comment (8): Not sure what else to call it.
Comment (9): What do you mean accused? The fucking traitor did it in public view.
Comment (10): Republican from New York Lee Zeldin in a C-Span interview after her statements defended the president by attacking Schiff. He said she wouldn't have even known about those tweets if Schiff hadn't brought them up during the hearing.

Credit to C-Span, a reporter asked what message that still sends to other witnesses, and he got flustered and deflected.
Comment (11): The balls on him. 

Does he want another article of impeachment? Cause that’s how he’ll get another article of impeachment.
Comment (12): He will get away with it. He will get away with all of it. He will spend the rest of his days basking in the sun, flying around with supermodels and big piles of cash. Like what the fuck is wrong with this world. His whole posse are a bunch of complicit fucks.
Comment (13): "Oh, that time he intimidated a witness? No, that's not witness intimidation." - Lindsay Fuckface McConnell

Just not the way you hoped. 

Imagine the possible possible way to spin this is that the president of the United States is a troll.
Comment (15): ...BuT hE's JuSt FiGhTiNg BaCk!
Comment (16): *On this episode of “Is it an Onion Story or Not?”...*
Comment (17): It's not so much an "accusation" as it is a "very obvious open-and-shut case."
Comment (18): Wow. He really doesn’t know when to shut the fuck up.
Comment (19): Gym Jordan with the lame excuse that Yovanovich wouldn't have known if Schiff didn't read it aloud. They're so pathetic
Comment (20): Committing an impeachable act while being impeached #justTrumpThings
Comment (21): We really need to have some systems in place for future presidents that immediately removes Dangerous Powers that they have while any investigations are going on. This guy in particular should be outside of the hearing somewhere in stocks where people can throw rotten food left him also limit any hurry to damage you can do
Comment (22): President Asshole.
Comment (23): And now we are talking about trump and not her testimony......

Comment (1): He created a group to get money out of politics years ago called Wolf PAC, and the movement of politicians not taking corporate bribes is growing all the time. He was one of the founders of Justice Democrats, of which Ro Khanna, AOC and the Squad and a lot of impressive people now in office are part of. And of course 'The Young Turks' is a long running youtube show he hosts that has relentlessly gone after corruption.

If you want to help someone that has been fighting for the rest of us for years, donate and volunteer. https://www.cenk2020.com/
Comment (2): People don't have to agree completely with every one of Cenk positions, but seeing more politicians like him would be a good thing: Anti-corruption, against the corporate takeover of democracy, and not there to make friends with other power players and lobbyists.
Comment (3): He's dead on when it comes to most things politics.

His speaking style can be a bit grating after a while though
Comment (4): >  **You know what campaign donations are from big corporations and lobbyists? Bribes.** 

This man has my vote as soon as he runs for something where I can vote for him.
Comment (5): He's a bit brash at times but he has a good mind set as long as he can stay professional as he has been he will do great
Comment (6): Love this guy. Thanks for fighting the good fight!!’
Comment (7): Awesome. I watch his show. It is good.
Comment (8): Yes! 👏
Comment (9): I like Cenk, hope he wins.  But that's up for that district to decide.
Comment (10): He's not wrong.
Comment (11): Not a huge fan of Cenk or TYT as a media entity, they're better than MSM.. but that is a pretty low bar.

Having said that,  I think he'd be much better than most of congress.
Comment (12): Is that Sly?
Comment (13): He’s not wrong.
Comment (14): Cenk has been a somewhat polarizing figure, but let's get one thing straight: This is what the messaging from modern day Democrats should look like if we are to truly represent people over corporate interests. Politicians are the way they are because the system selects for that type of individual. Individuals who don't really disrupt the status quo and ultimately do a lot of talking without getting anything done. What has happened is that both parties have been largely compromised by their entanglement with big moneyed interests and it's about damn time we have people like Bernie Sanders, AOC, and now Cenk coming in like a wrecking ball and shaping the narrative.
Comment (15): I have never watched TYT. Maybe I'll check it out and see what I think.
Comment (16): Cenk would be better than 99.9% of congress. He deserves our vote.
Comment (17): Hell yeah. Having him in congress would be amazing
Comment (18): I look forward to him winning, and then voting yes on a bill that while imperfect still moves the country toward progressiveness.   

And then I look forward to some gadfly asshole attacking him for that vote.
Comment (19): There's already a strong local candidate in this race.  Splitting support in favor of a famous carpetbagger -- no matter how much you may like him politically -- undercuts the main purpose of having house districts even if it's allowed under California law.

How is this better than Papadopoulos on the other side?

https://ballotpedia.org/Christy_Smith
Comment (20): Can you I'ma Cenk in a debate vs Papadapolous??

Or him questioning people summoned by congress. 

100% donating to see Cenk in Congress.  Love TYT.

He's going to raise an insane amount of money compared to his competition and will likely get endorsements from AOC & the rest of the sqad.
Comment (21): I hate Cenk. He’s emotional, arrogant, narrow-minded and self-obsessed. He’s extremely tribalistic and thinks he’s several tiers smarter than he actually is.

I know I’ll get downvoted for this, but if Cenk was white he would 100% be a republican.
Comment (22): There’s already a dem in the race endorsed by Hill; splitting the vote is gonna give the race to trump’s crony. He should run when there’s more time so the voters can have a real primary. This is a historically republican seat so splitting the dem vote in a special election is hardly a winning strategy
Comment (23): I don't get why anyone on the left is even considering supporting this man. Until 2013 he held vile views on women and until 2016 he denied the Armenian genocide. 

>In an entry from 2000, Uygur complained about not having enough sex while living in Miami: “It seems like there is a sea of tits here, and I am drinking in tiny droplets. I want to dive into the whole god damn ocean,” he wrote. “Obviously, the genes of women are flawed. They are poorly designed creatures who do not want to have sex nearly as often as needed for the human race to get along peaceably and fruitfully.”

There [are many, many more](https://www.thewrap.com/young-turks-cenk-uygur-blog-breasts-women-flawed/).
Comment (24): This guy has a meToo problem. Literally has an incel mentality, called women whores in training for not wanting to screw him. Hes resentful because white women didnt find him desirable. 

He also used to openly hit on his co host who is also not interested in him at all on his internet show.

This guy also has a serious problem with having denied the Armenian genocide multiple times.

This man is sick and gross

Comment (28): Oh god no please no...
Comment (29): If you want to explore the level of Cenk’s idiocy just watch his interview with Sam Harris, if you can make it through the entire thing without wanting to throw the smug asshole out of a window you will be the first.
Comment (30): I'm sure he'll take plenty of money from Bloomberg.
Comment (31): [removed]
Comment (32): He promotes too many conspiracy theories - regardless if you align with his strong liberal views - I would be turned off with the nonsense he’s peddled on his program.
Comment (33): Friendly reminder that this man denied a genocide
Comment (34): Doesn't he deny the Armenian genocide?
Comment (35): Just some jerk gettin' into office so he can get out for the payday. I see it every year. Some clown runs for office, drops out of the race and gets a big chunk of dough. I mean, you have to be a real low-life piece of shit to get involved in politics.
Comment (36): Cenk's a loud mouth idiot. But on the other hand he'd vote for progressive agenda. So I'm somewhat torn. There are absolutely better people out there. But if he can win I'll support him.
Comment (37): does he still deny the armenian genocide?

Comment (2): "I need you to do me a favor, though..."
Comment (3): So.....more bribes?
Comment (4): That "smile" he puts on certainly seems desperate. It looks to me like he's a cat trying to eat a canary that he's holding in his mouth, and  he simultaneously wants to swallow  the bird and spit the feathers out.
Comment (5): So Tweety is bribing them --  true to form.
Comment (6): He’s gonna get away with this. This country will mean nothing after this impeachment is over. 

Our only chance is to GET THE VOTE OUT.
Comment (7): So, using my tax dollars to further corruption.  Can't say I'm real happy with that or with the Party of Fiscal Responsibility helping him do it.
Comment (8): Good job you have separation of powers over there.

> WASHINGTON - The impeachment process has now reached a new phase, and that means Republicans and President Trump are no longer laughing it off.

> On Wednesday, Trump invited five Senate Republicans - who will ultimately be the jurors if the House votes to impeach - to the White House for his meeting with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo?an.

> The GOP has also been getting an assist from a White House that&#039;s finally trying to unify its messaging operation by getting its communications team on the same page as the president&#039;s legal team.

Comment (10): Trump is bribing the jury and intimidating witnesses.
Comment (11): Pepe went a-courtin’ and he did fly, womp womp.
Comment (12): I got these hamberdersss maaaan
Comment (13): My Congressman, Guy Reschenthaler, was recently gushing about a ride on Air Force One. He is the biggest Trump bootlicker there is. He's super embarrassing and spends the majority of his time praising Trump and criticizing Democrats. I hate him.
Comment (14): Briba-me?!? Briba-you!!
Comment (15): I hope they are bringing tape recorders....
Comment (16): Headline needs to read "our tax dollars are being used courting..."

That way they can deny that's wrong too and call it fake news after reading it
Comment (17): Can we start French revolutioning these guys already?
Comment (18): Flaunting his money and power, and trying to keep his subordinates in line. Oh my god, Trump is like Dorian Gray to the Republican's Anastasia! A  shitty book plot becomes an even shittier reality.
Comment (19): “Come, come, lay under this bus for me. It’s the best bus, trust me. I promise we won’t drive the bus.”
Comment (20): I hope that a trip on Air Force One is worth violating the constitution and the trust of their constituents.
Comment (21): You mean like jury tampering?
Comment (22): “A UFC crowd is not like going to the Metropolitan Opera. But he loved it. He kept saying, ‘These are my people. These are my people.’”
Comment (23): Ive been checking out different subreddits in regards to the impeachment trial going on and his supporters for the most part seem to have disappeared.
Comment (24): "I think it's important that the President and his team be able to tell their side of the story...Unfortunately they haven't been able to."

Like excuse me, wtf? There's been nothing but a firehose of bullshit spraying from the direction of the President and his team for months, at whichever angle suits them in the moment. It's getting to the point that it's difficult to ascertain which side of the story they HAVEN'T told...

Comment (1): He inherited a steadily growing economy and looted it for the 0.01%.
Comment (2): He exploded the deficit w his tax breaks for the rich & corporations.
Comment (3): Aside from the tariffs that reduced US GDP by $35 billion and drove up the prices Americans pay for goods from China.

Trump's tariffs on foreign goods are equivalent to a new tax on Americans. Where is Grover Norquist? He should be protesting.
Comment (4): I think we need to give Trump the credit he deserves here.  

* Imposed tariffs that have [driven **down** wages 0.5% and cost 0.66% of the long run GDP](https://taxfoundation.org/tariffs-trump-trade-war/)
* Along with Republican party, signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act [which will add $1.51 trillion to the debt, before accounting for interest or possible gimmicks. This cost would likely be enough to **cause debt to exceed the size of the economy by 2028**](https://www.crfb.org/blogs/tax-cut-and-jobs-act-will-cost-15-trillion).
* Introduced so much market uncertainty and volatility that [J.P. Morgan created the Volfefe - volatility+covfefe - (not joking) index to track Trump's impact on market volatility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volfefe_index).
* Provided 28 billion dollars to bailout farmers who have been decimated by the tariffs.  A cost [more than double that of the auto bailout of the Great Recession](https://www.freep.com/story/money/business/john-gallagher/2019/09/24/farmer-bailout-payments-china-trade-tariffs/2418676001/) and one that will not be repayed.
* Increased the national debt by over 10% in two years, [pushing the US national debt to a record high 22+ trillion dollars and shooting up](https://www.npr.org/2019/02/13/694199256/u-s-national-debt-hits-22-trillion-a-new-record-thats-predicted-to-fall).  This after Trump promised he would eliminate the debt.

There's plenty more.  I'll edit this as I think of them and have a few more sips of my own covfefe.
Comment (5): .. but instead of going up, it now is going down.
Comment (6): He's doing everything he can to prop up the economy. It's limping along for that reason. The Farmer bailouts are only one example of the results of trumps policy.
Comment (7): He and Fox went from shitting on it to praising it.

-

-

...then he undermined it with insane tax cuts for the rich
Comment (8): 4% growth over the last 22 months. 


He succeeded in stalling Obama's economy
Comment (9): *With more deregulation.
Comment (10): Their argument will be “well he didn’t make it worse!” Because they have zero understanding of macro economic forces due to having a 12th grade education, and can’t grasp that its set up to topple over.
Comment (11): It’s worse... everything costs more because of the tariffs and wage stagnation has ramped up. This “feels” exactly like the early days of the last recession (at least in my area), when everyone kept saying the economy was great but everything they were doing wasn’t something you would do if the economy was great. Usually it takes Republicans close full two terms to ruin the economy but Trump and his administration has masterfully done it in less than 3.
Comment (12): This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/trump-didnt-transform-the-economy-its-mostly-the-same-as-it-was-under-obama-2019-11-12?mod=economy-politics) reduced by 90%. (I'm a bot)
*****
> Despite Trump&#039;s desperation to juice the economy with tax cuts, spending increases and interest-rate cuts from the Federal Reserve, there&#039;s been only a modest and temporary uptick in the growth rate.

> All of the extra growth since 2017 was provided by a fiscal boost from tax cuts and spending increases as Republican lawmakers turned from austerity budgets under Obama to stimulus under Trump.

> Trump managed to squeeze a little more growth out of the economy, but at the cost of hundreds of billions of dollars from the Treasury.

Comment (13): "Cool.  Your guy didn't crash Obama's plane."
Comment (14): Whaaa....hold on a minute.....the economy was transformed??!!

Looks like the same shitshow to me. Billionaires still taking everything from the little guy.
Comment (15): Minus the manufacturing recession
Comment (16): Yep I agree this good economy started under Obama and is a result of Obama's policies. The next president is going to have to deal with a poor economy do to the poor policies of Trump.
Comment (17): Yall got to remember that numbers that were bad under the the evil, brown Muslim are awe inspiring under the the king of the hicks
Comment (18): With a few of the pylons knocked out here and there.
Comment (19): A dipshit cousin of mine was touting how great "Trump's economy" was on his second day in office.
Comment (20): This is a bad headline because it fails to account for the fact that growth itself is a major part of the economy.

Trump took Obama's economy and then **ground the ongoing growth to a screeching halt**.
Comment (21): Oh he transformed it.  He saddled it with a monstrous debt so the billionaire class could have a few more good years
Comment (22): There are actually more people unemployed now than at the start of the great recession. The unemployment numbers are not very scientific and anyone who is unemployed for more than 6 months drops off the list.
Comment (23): That's not accurate at all. Rich people have achieved much more liquid wealth, more safety nets for their third mansions, and they have received more power for their lobbies and publication of money into politics...

I'm sorry, idk who measures the economy but it isn't the same as it was under Obama... The presumes we had health insurance, childcare, and a safe nonpolluting way to get to work. 

Everybody better start growing their own food NOW

Not to feed yourself but to learn how. And also to supplement your diet with free food.

Lawns should be illegal. 

Climate change is here, what have you done today? Sometimes that means what have you not done, or who have you argued with.
Comment (24): Republicans act like there is a shot clock for the Presidency, and that there is no carryover. And it works because their voters believe it. They sincerely believed Obama killed the economy because GWB gave it to him.
Comment (25): My conservative family keeps talking about the economy being amazing under Trump and won't hear it when I tell them practically nothing has changed since Obama. If anything it has gotten worse. The Tax Cuts were only a sugar rush that ultimately didn't do much and manufacturing is actually now in a recession. So wtf did Trump do exactly? I never get a straight answer.
Comment (26): He did transform the economy. He greased the brakes. 

Guaranteed to go faster but there's virtually no control. 

He has pressured the fed to lower rates. He gave huge tax breaks in perpetuity for corporations. Corporations are flush with cash and nothing to do with it because they don't want to invest at the height of the market.
Comment (27): Except he destabilized it by starting a trade war, and he plans to end the trade war just in time for election season.

Watch.
Comment (28): Well, yeah, we know. What policy has Trump made that is actually good for the economy, other than tax cuts for the extremely rich (which doesn't help the economy at all).
Comment (29): He did make it worst with his China tariffs
Comment (30): No, it is not the same at all. Not even freaking use. 

I remember struggling so hard to find a job. Nearly all my friends would talk about sending 50 applications and never getting a call. 

I was stuck in a dead end job and struggling super fucking hard. I was educated, went to good schools and I couldnt get out at all. I fucking cried and sunk into a depression because nobody would hire me and I was on the verge of being fire, the shitty corporation I was working for was laying people off left and right. Obama's america and economy was fucking awful, it was an extension of the bush era, literally.


2016 rolls around and everything changed. God bless trump
Comment (31): And no ones thanks Ivanka for the 14 million jobs she created?. WTF?.
Comment (32): I remember when he’d say these job numbers don’t include people who stopped looking for work. Crickets ever since he took office. The GDP spiked when they gave all the money to billionaires to inflate their stock prices through buybacks and lining their pockets twice. Obama added more jobs in his first three years then Trump did. All the polices put into place under Obama are now propping up the economy. Despite Trumps best efforts to slap tariffs on multiple countries. And guess what, we have to pay that bill. And are so-called tax cuts expire.
Comment (33): He’s just not making the richest and the biggest companies pay taxes. 
We’re borrowing the extra profits from my kids.
Comment (34): Trump criticized Obama during before 2016 and those criticisms are still true now that he’s president. He has done nothing to make life better for Americans.
Comment (35): Not true.  Trump took the good that Obama did and has successfully overheated the economy to a point of definite failure.  There are now multiple bubbles ready to burst.  It’s a matter of time.
Comment (36): US' world image, though...
Comment (37): He didn’t, but he redistributed wealth.
Comment (38): Manufacturing is down and unemployment is rising.
Comment (39): When i post on my local news group that the econmoy is not better with trump they always post that unemployment is low and that their retirement pension is better.  Im guessing their 401k.   Why is that?
Comment (40): It's about perception. 

Obama is driving the car directly West. 

* Liberals: I trust Obama, so West must be the good way to go.

* Republicans: Obama is evil and bad, so if he chose West, West must be bad!!

Trump takes over and keeps the car driving West

* Liberals: Trump doesn't know what the fuck he's doing, so anything that goes wrong on this path is his fault!!

* Republicans: Trump knows what he's doing! I'm sure he fixed SOMETHING under the hood even though I don't know what, so really, it's good now, definitely. 

I feel bad for Republicans who got none of what they were hoping for other than fear, hatred, and racism baked back into US policy.

Comment (1): He's as empathetic as a shrub.
Comment (2): If he spoke about Santa Clarita then he WOULDNT BE ABLE TO talk about gun rights.  It was calculated, Santa Clarita lost.
Comment (3): Anyone who expected character, empathy, sympathy, morality, intelligence or bravery from this man had never heard of him until he ran for POTUS.
Comment (4): And this comes at absolutely no surprise. Also, seeing as how I live in Louisiana, I can assure you that the people their likely could care less about the shooting vs. Their "God given freedom"

I need to move.
Comment (5): Slimy diaper Don
Comment (6): “Take the guns first, due process later.”

Comment (7): And how silly is this that this insecure, mentally-challenged little boy needs to be constantly validated in these ridiculous "rallies"?  No other politician has needed these constant cries of adoration.

He [even made his cabinet](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-cabinet/at-trumps-cabinet-meeting-flattery-is-flavor-of-the-day-idUSKBN19400P) sing his praises in a cringe-worthy spectacle before the press.

trump is clearly [mentally ill](https://www.salon.com/2019/07/22/understanding-our-bully-in-chief-donald-trumps-antisocial-personality-disorder-fits-a-pattern/).  There's no point in denying it.
Comment (8): To be fair, nobody is directly paying him to talk about the shooting. He's not going to pass on NRA money when the alternative is not money.
Comment (9): Like trump gives a shit about dead children.
Comment (10): Well yeah, that checks out.
Comment (11): Another glorious day in the upside down.
Comment (12): he was too busy wiping his butthole mouth poorly. there's still shit everywhere
Comment (13): trump is the stupidest piece of shit to ever hold public office.
Comment (14): Okay okay, but what color were they children? What were they wearing? - Trump probably
Comment (15): It’s not a bug, it’s a feature.
Comment (16): He's not even trying at this point. He knows he's fucked.
Comment (17): Maybe because, like many idiots, he thinks it's a false flag
Comment (18): Santa Clarita. He likely thinks it didn’t happen in the US, with a name like that. 
Not like it matters.
Comment (19): The problem is the number of guns.
Comment (20): That's because he doesn't give a shit about people, only votes
Comment (21): The guns already have enough rights. Let's get some more human rights up in here.
Comment (22): Guns don’t kill, people kill people
Comment (23): To republicans, any number of innocent human lives are worth it if a republican felon can still have multiple guns.
Comment (24): This school shooting will get little media coverage for 3 reasons:

1) He didn't use an AR.

2) He's Asian not White.

3) Nothing will interrupt the democrats and their show trial .
Comment (25): The shooting happened in a gun free zone in the state with the most restrictive gun laws with and illegal handgun by a person who was under age. Please tell me how any further gun laws would have stopped this shooting.

A person determined to hurt others will always find a way. Even if guns no longer existed they would have used a knife or went to a hardware store and bought materials to make a bomb. Don't blame the tool used, blame the person using the tool.

What would have prevented this is armed and trained staff at the school. Immediate first responders able to put the threat down as it acts. Unfortunately, the ones who were obeying the gun free zone law were fish in a barrel. Unable to defend themselves.
Comment (26): Pig with the brain of a slug.

Comment (1): >A federal appeals court ruled this week that the Trump administration illegally excluded **millions of tons of dangerous and toxic materials in public use from a safety review.**

And Trump is raging against Pelosi on Twitter over the environment.
Comment (2): > A coalition of unions, safety advocates and scientific groups sued in 2017 to block the EPA’s narrower reading of the safety review. Firefighter and construction worker groups alleged that ignoring the toxic products that were still in use could risk their health.

Thank you all for keeping an eye on the EPA
Comment (3): >A three-judge panel in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Thursday that the Environmental Protection Agency must include risks **from asbestos, lead and other toxins ** regardless of whether or not they are currently being produced.

Make America ~~Great~~ Metastatize Again
Comment (4): I do enjoy that the Trump administration is completely destroying the narrative that departments like the EPA are somehow uncontrolled.

Seeing all their bullshit shot down should show to people (not the ones that need to hear it, but eh) that they don't just make up rules in a bubble. They do it within the guidance of their department, and following laws and regulations.  It's not just ad-hoc and random, and when it is, it can be taken to court.
Comment (5): Cartoon villainy level of corruption.
Comment (6): Fuck these toxic leaders and their toxic chemicals. Fuck all this shit.
Comment (7): This does nothing to make America great.
Comment (8): How many "Unlawful" acts can be committedby our Government before some kind of enforcement of law is actually enforced?.

Comment (1): > Though the president has retained Giuliani as his personal lawyer throughout the Ukraine scandal, GOP lawmakers are reportedly pressing Trump to ditch him in order to create some distance between himself and Giuliani’s efforts to push the quid pro quo in Ukraine.

Giuliani has insurance
Comment (2): Oh, the Rudy Giuliani who's minions were caught fleeing the country? THAT Rudy Giuliani?
Comment (3): Only the "best" people. 

Trump always wants the biggest things. Now he has the biggest piece of crap as lawyer.
Comment (4): I will patiently wait for the pending arrest and frog walk pictures.
Comment (5): America’s Mayor!
Comment (6): What are the odds that Trump has shit on Rudy dating back to NYC? Seems like a corrupt rich guy could corrupt a craven politician and cousin fucker like Rudy pretty easily.
Comment (7): Seems like everyone who works for Trump ends up going to prison.  Trump is safe because he can't be indicted as long as he holds his office.  Sounds like the perfect medium for a con-artist to continue committing his crimes, making money, growing his empire, and getting away with it.

Edit:  Thanks kind soul for the gold.
Comment (2): >VanderKooi told investigators his initial reason for contacting ICE was a concern Ramos-Gomez’s trespassing could have terrorism implications.

Give me a break. When all else fails, use the big bad T-word.
Comment (3):  

"Any society where it's a crime or a hassle to be different is a society based on psychological fascism"
Comment (4): Melt ICE.
Comment (5): The new Gestapo.
Comment (6): ICE:  Government jobs for stupid, useless pricks who hate government.
Comment (7): I’m reminded of Trump’s comments about McCain not being a war hero as a POW  because he got caught.  Fucking trash.
Comment (8): ICE is composed of rejects from other agencies
Comment (9): ICE stands for "I Create Ethnostates"
Comment (10): i dont understand why its shocking that these people would wrongfully detain a troop after we already know that they're extremely cool with building concentration camps for children. And, like, a lot of those children dying.
Comment (11): Service guarantees citizenship.

Or it should.
Comment (12): These ICE guys are the rejects who weren’t good enough for the military or law enforcement. They can’t stand it when an immigrant or minority excels because it shows their own mediocrity. What a bunch of losers.
Comment (13): What a grotesque police state. Liberty and justice, my ass.
Comment (14): ICE is composed of the bottom of the barrel of other agencies. It needs to be abolished.
Comment (15): Well considering all the dudes I knew that ended up at ICE were military/police/prison guard washouts, I'm not surprised.
Comment (16): ICE don't give a shit about anyone. They're like Nazi brownshirts, the SA. A paramilitary force.
Comment (17): GOP is high key acting patriotic.

Low key they fuck veteran out of charity money and out of citizenship.
Comment (18): This was a test to see how far they can get with their powers.
Comment (19): ICE using their [official "spot the illegal immigrant" checks](https://imgur.com/ry6Vq2e).
Comment (20): ICE has become our not so secret police. Detain citizens without any actual repercussions.  I think we may have gone full V-for-Vendetta
Comment (21): I think you guys might have a Gestapo problem...
Comment (22): ICE is...ice is....ice-is....ISIS. Makes sense to me.
Comment (23): Detaining without reasonable suspicion should be considered the same as kidnapping. Police should be spending their lives in prison after they do it.
Comment (24): Abolish ICE.
Comment (25): 
I have only one question - why should taxpayers pay for the settlement. Let's deduct it from ICE pension fund
Comment (26): So we have more evidence that Republicans hate the troops.

Wow, *everything they say* is projection!!
Comment (27): No-fault settlements should be criminal in and of themselves. No-one gets the blame, no-one gets punished, except the taxpayer. It's crazy.
Comment (28): What I want to know is why are Trump supporters so okay with a Russian take over, yet they gladly deport the Latino soldiers keeping this country safe from places like Putin's Russia.

Also why do they want to build a wall on the SOUTHERN border, when Russia is currently one of the biggest threats and would invade from the north? Wouldn't it make more sense to build a wall north of Canada?

Also... For a country that prides itself so much on the military the USA treats it's veterans really badly. There's so many homeless vets, and so little military spending actually goes to veteran retirement or veteran medical bills.

At this point, I don't think there's anything left to be patriotic over, if there ever was. A country that prides itself on military yet treats veterans horribly and... Even going to the point of extreme racism of deporting Latino veterans... I am struggling to see how any can find reason to be patriotic about the USA anymore.
Comment (29): We seriously need to arrest all employees of ICE and deport them to Australia, revoke their citizenship status, and place them on a no fly list. This is getting out of hand. They're abducting and detaining American citizens. Unlawful stop and search, kidnapping children, etc. I feel it is absolutely necessary to label ICE a terrorist organization and citizens of the United States should be given the right to shoot them on sight with no repercussions.
Comment (30): He's the wrong color of course, you silly goose.
Comment (31): the actual US government under trump would like to do that to ALL veterans
Comment (32): Papers, Please
Comment (33): What could be the possible reason of detaining?
Comment (34): Abolish ICE now
Comment (35): I love how they look at his obvious U.S. passport and still had trouble discerning his citizenship. The illegals are making it hard for us to live in peace and serve our country. The terrorists(FOP) SHOULD STAY IN THEIR LANES.
Comment (36): Police? Supporting fascism? In my America?

Well tickle me pink this is surely a surprise.
Comment (37): Put ICE on ice
Comment (38): So what happens when you are unlawfully detained by ICE as a U.S. citizen? Can you sue the government for damages?
Comment (39): I feel like we have a pretty good chance that ICE isn't gonna survive the upcoming election.  Unless people don't get out and vote.  So yeah, please go do that.
Comment (40): Well, of course they did. He's clearly a POC. What other evidence do those motherfucker in ICE need? 

"Case closed!"

~ICE Agents probably
Comment (41): All of news agencies (that don't rhyme with Pox) need to get this veteran on television.

His story needs to be a nail in the eye of Trump Supporters.
Comment (42): At this point u can’t say it’s not just racism
Comment (43): Dismantle ICE now.
Comment (44): Reminder: abolishing ICE is the moderate position. The more extreme position is abolishing ICE and prosecuting all these assholes.
Comment (45): ICE is out of control
Comment (46): Shame
Comment (47): Wtf
Comment (48): Why should anyone volunteer to serve a racist country?
Comment (49): Man I keep hearing all these stories about service members being illegally determined. What about of the non service people? It can’t just so happen they keep grabbing service members. I’m confused and feel like maybe there’s a lot more stories out there.
Comment (50): Creepy
Comment (51): 190K for sitting in a cell for 3 days. I feel so bad for him
Comment (52): Abolish ice and open the borders.
Comment (53): Bernie Sanders on ICE: Get rid of it.

Elizabeth Warren on ICE: We need it
Comment (54): [deleted]
Comment (55): And now he's 190K better off. Shitty event that shouldnt have happened but at least he got something out of it.
Comment (56): Ice Ice baby
Comment (57): Proper investigation should be done on him. Authorities took the right action.
Comment (58): Can you say, CHA CHING $$$$
Comment (59): Lol he doesn't even look like a citizen though, reasonable mistake
Comment (60): I wonder why he was arrested originally?
Comment (61): Lol 😂 military my asss

Comment (1): At least one good thing came out of his nomination hearing--I reported my 2012 rape to the police, who opened an investigation. Christine Blasey-Ford's bravery was inspiring!
Comment (2): Honoring him for what?

It's been a hot minute since he screamed his way to the Supreme Court like an angry alcoholic possum.

What's he done, exactly?
Comment (3): > [A huge video of Christine Blasey-Ford's testimony to Congress played on Thursday night just outside of a gala honoring Justice Brett Kavanaugh.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OX5Fcd8syp8) According to a HuffPost reporter, the video played on a giant screen before Federalist Society gala attendees in front of Washington D.C.'s Union Station. The screen was reportedly erected by progressive group Demand Justice, who wants to see Kavanaugh impeached from the Supreme Court. Protesters with anti-Kavanaugh chants and a sign that read “Kavanaugh Lied” were also seen in front of the event.

...
Comment (4): Regardless of the accusations or their credibility, this dipshit clearly demonstrated during the hearings that he has no business being on the Supreme Court. 

The guy was groomed from birth. Every skid was greased from the time he started walking. He was sliding along just fine toward the brass ring of the SC when someone threw sand on the skid and he got a rash on his butt. 

His demeanor was fitting of the spoiled brat he is. Yelling, crying, and basically sucking his thumb. There is no way this guy should have been approved based strictly on his actions at the hearings and I hope someone can figure a way to get his ass off the court.
Comment (5): He needs to be impeached for lying to the Senate.
Comment (6): It’s wild a nominee for the Supreme Court goes in front of Congress, screams “I like beer” with tears coming out his eyes and spit dribbling out his mouth, while he pounds the table with his fist, and he’s a hero to half the country.

Crazy, crazy, crazy world we live in. Can’t imagine what history books are going to say about this era. I hope you all are soaking this up because we’re living through some truly historic moments.
Comment (7): Kavenaugh's supporters want us to believe that rape or assault doesn't matter when you're young & in school.
Comment (8): What the fuck, did he get a rape medal?
Comment (9): Honoring this guy? Wtf is wrong with the US?
Comment (10): White privilege poster boy
Comment (11): Any judge that is a part of the Federalist society should be disbarred for life because it simply admits they have no intention of being impartial.
Comment (12): These people have no fucking morals
Comment (13): I still can’t believe none of the Democrats on the committee asked him about Ed Whelan.
Comment (14): All of his guests know her allegations are true.
Comment (15): I still couldn’t get over his evangelical/Christian support after it coming out that they literally bonged beer in their ass and had threesomes which were semi gay (mmf is always questionable in my mind). Then I remember all of the religious conservative politicians and church leaders being busted for soliciting gay sex in bathrooms and elsewhere.
Comment (16): What's to be honored in him is beyond me.
Comment (17): Take the senate.

Impeach Kavanaugh for lying under oath.
Comment (18): Can't see much 'honor' in that picture.
Comment (19): Good. Fuck Brett kavanaugh
Comment (20): Goddamn, I hate Brett Kavanaugh and Georgetown prep.  It’s like a breeding ground for rapists and idiots.
Comment (21): Good, this federalist society fuck nugget should never have been confirmed to begin with.
Comment (22): A gala sponsored by Facebook...
Comment (23): To quote Kavanaugh from his own senate hearing: "What goes around comes around."
Comment (24): Honoring? What has the rapist done that he deserves any honor? Successfully raped his 100th victim?
Comment (25): I saw a tweet on twitter that perfectly summed up my feelings for Kavanaugh

I will never accept the normalization of Kavanaugh.
Comment (26): Conservatives need to get used to constant public ridicule.
Comment (27): Are they celebrating that people can get away with rape?
Comment (28): That’s something out of a movie
Comment (29): Sniveling little shit
Comment (30): Well since he “won” that court case he probably feels pride watching her testimony!
Comment (31): Sounds like a real gathering of assholes.
Comment (32): The world is fucked up
Comment (33): I bet Brett drank so much beer at that gala. He loves beer
Comment (34): ‘Honoring’ an asshole with no honor
Comment (35):  I realize Reddit seeks to keep a modicum of decency, but it’s hard to ignore just what a sick, perverse bunch of people these people are. And they seem to have no idea of their degradation.
Comment (36): Beerbong Brett is a rapist.
Comment (37): For those wondering why Kavanaugh is being honored, it is because the gala was thrown by the Federalist society, a fairly far right organization focused on identifying and developing a pipeline conservative legal scholars who they can eventually move into judicial posts. 

A must read...

The Conservative Pipeline to the Supreme Court

With the Federalist Society, Leonard Leo has reared a generation of originalist élites. The selection of Neil Gorsuch is just his latest achievement.

https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/17/the-conservative-pipeline-to-the-supreme-court
Comment (38): How did the Senate approve a rapist to SCOTUS? Oh right, because they are Rape-ublicans.
Comment (39): Hopefully he made a journal entry about the gala.
Comment (40): Of course they're honoring him, he'll be deciding on Trump's taxes soon, not that we don't already know how he'll side but gotta rub his ego a bit first.
Comment (41): Does anyone have a link to the pic of him crying. I wanna share that on twitter.
Comment (42): Cringe
Comment (43): Who wants to honor this lying chode?
Comment (44): The fuck has he done to deserve honors? He seems like a complete piece of shit,
Comment (45): Kavanaugh should be in prison, not on the Supreme Court.
Comment (46): Never stop reminding the fascists that we know what they are.
Comment (47): But I thought his life is ruined, boo boo.
Comment (48): Ladies and gentlemen.. the one, the only, Boof Kavanaugh !
Comment (49): Why do people forget the concept of "innocent until proven guilty"?

I get it, the guy is Trump appointed and is a scumbag, but this whole assumption that everyone is guilty is getting fucking annoying.
Comment (50): Serious question here, sorry if it sounds rude or anything. Wasn't all of her testimony basically disproved or discredited? I thought the other women she named that was at this party said it did not happen.

Not sure why I am being downvoted for a serious question? Please tell me if I am wrong.
Comment (51): But he still likes beer and throws tantrums when asked about his college career, so that means he can't be a bad person according to the republicans.
Comment (52): Petition to rename "Politics" "Politicscirclejerk" next post will cover the bravery of Jussie Smollet fighting against the frivolous lawsuits of the Justice system.
Comment (53): I saw a new book today at the library that was called:

Pettiness and perpetual outrage: How make sure Trump wins the 2020 election.
Comment (54): Joe Biden believes these people will abandon their ways and work with him
Comment (55): What happened to Kavanaugh is precisely why we need the Electoral College. The fact so many of you truly believe *any* of the allegations is stunning, but even more stunning is how you willingly accept a process where LITERALLY no evidence was presented, it almost destroyed an accomplished jurist, and you don’t even care. 

The Electoral College recognizes how easily Americans can be persuaded and it guards against the gullible from having too much influence on an election.
Comment (56): imagine if he is innocent and people are literally hounding him with this anyway
Comment (57): Brilliant
Comment (58): KFC doesn’t belong, he’s giving blowjobs.
Comment (59): Front page, too.

EDIT: [Video for context](https://twitter.com/notoriousbag_/status/1151168973138026502?s=21)

Comment (2): Half of Trumps inner circle under indictment
Comment (3): I'm ready to see Rudy go far, far away.
Comment (4): Make  
Attorneys  
Get  
Attorneys
Comment (5): "America's Mayor" Rudy has pissed off (on) too many people. With Trump's current problems, who is going to save/shield him?
Comment (6): The only reason he's walking around free is because he's outing more accomplices as he flails around like a drunk 60s Batman villain.

He's a good resource for law enforcement, by virtue of his dumbassery.
Comment (7): Pretty pretty please.   That would be an awesome Christmas gift
Comment (8): This is similar to what got Cohen sent to jail. Trump just doesn’t learn.

Comment (1): If anything, she should double-down on impeachment.
Comment (2): To clarify. She a (D) House Rep for Williamsburg, VA. She won in last year's election turning over a long held (R) seat.

She's vulnerable because there are a lot of old people in that area, who believe in closed-door impeachment from Democrats locking out Republicans, also that Democrats are not doing enough to support senior health care.
Comment (3): OMFG a politician who stands on principle and not what will keep them in power.

Amazing.
Comment (4): Gonna go out on a limb and guess she's a democrat. Because there's not a single republican left with any integrity.
Comment (5): Lol good I voted for her.
Comment (6): I wrote her a letter this year asking her to vote against Nancy Pelosi when the vote for speaker of the house comes up again because Pelosi was so anti-impeachment. I’m glad it won’t have to come to that, and I will happily vote for Laurie again next year!
Comment (7): I’m sorry but I’m not super impressed. She’s doing her fucking job.
Comment (8): Sad doing a basic job function is newsworthy
Comment (9): I think there are going to be a lot of recalcitrant democrats who are going to be really sorry they ever delayed impeachment, when the fully stocked conservative judiciary over rules any new legislation for years to come.

History will not be kind to them, and process arguments will not be looked at with the benefit of the doubt we gave them in real time. They will have been out maneuvered for no gain.

Comment (2): We teachers have decent healthcare for the most part but we are fighting for all Americans to have healthcare.

"Not me. Us."

Comment (3): This is huge since Cali is voting on Super Tuesday.
Comment (4): Catching some major Bane vibes in the thumbnail. I’m all for it.
Comment (5): Big endorsements from Nurses and Teachers Unions in the same week.  The working class feels the bern!
Comment (6): This man should be the next president of the US. This is how the country begins to heal from the past 30 years.
Comment (7): Are there unions who don't support Bernie?
Comment (8): That's great news... I think Bernie Sanders is this nations best hope. Both to try to fix the screwed up way it started a few hundred years ago, and the more recent screw ups the Trump administration has been making run rampant lately.
Comment (9): Hell yeah. Vote bernie
Comment (10): This is huge for the CA primary, right?
Comment (11): It’s no surprise the unions love Bernie.
Comment (12): I’m sure that THIS is the endorsement that will finally catapult Bernie out of third place!

Comment (2): So if I am against fascists, I'm antifa right? /s
Comment (3): He hires the best of the best racists.
Comment (4): He's a neo-Nazi slimebag.

Which of course means Trump will defend him.
Comment (5): So, Trump has been hiding his emails?  On a server?  In Ukraine?

*****
> A collection of emails published by the Southern Poverty Law Center show Stephen Miller, White House senior adviser in charge of immigration policy, espousing racist views and promoting white supremacist and neo-Nazi publications prior to his joining the Trump administration.

> According to her, Breitbart officials, then including former Trump campaign chairman and White House aide Stephen Bannon, introduced her to Miller in 2015 with an understanding that he would influence the direction of the publication&#039;s reporting.

> &quot;What Stephen Miller sent to me in those emails has become policy at the Trump administration,&quot; McHugh told the SPLC. McHugh, who was an editor for Breitbart from April 2014 to June 2017, leaked the emails to the SPLC in June.

Comment (1): The headline omission is unfortunate, it should read ["Devos illegally refuses..."](https://www.politico.com/news/2019/10/24/judge-holds-betsy-devos-in-contempt-057012)

If you or I refused to obey a judge's order we'd be in jail. Instead her "penalty" is to have the government charged a fine (paid by us) for her crime.
Comment (2): DeVos may be among the most abhorrent human beings alive.
Comment (3): Time to put DeVos in jail for contempt.
Comment (4): Devos literally staffed all the highest positions in the Dept. of Education with former CEO's of private student loan companies. Almost as bad as making a former Exxon Mobil CEO the secretary of state or something. 

If a "socialist" South American country was doing half the shit this administration is, we'd have already invaded them.
Comment (5): Can we *please* look into that strange server she was hosting as a go between for Trump and that Russian bank?  

Edit: First gold! Thanks, stranger.
Comment (6): DeVos is a ghoul. Worst in the cabinet.
Comment (7): Throw her in jail for defying the court.
Comment (8): >Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is in a standoff with Democrats over why she is refusing to forgive the debts of tens of thousands of borrowers who say they were defrauded by for-profit colleges.

6-min

Edit: If you want to pull all your hair out, here’s a 3:30 min video of Sen Patty Murray getting DeVoss (and her staff) to admit she hasn’t processed a single student application since a judge ordered her to, 6 months previously. 
https://youtu.be/ryv_SdwWP8c
Comment (9): Well yeah, that's how she makes her money.

This is the whole point of the GOP's campaign of regulatory capture and why they fought so hard to stay in power. They're all putting their kleptocrat friends in charge of the offices that should be overseeing their industries.
Comment (10): I was a graphic designer at University of Phoenix for a summer and they demanded me to misrepresent or exclude almost every piece of info I had to make graphics for, in order to show alumni and investors how good they were doing (they were not doing good, which would’ve been easily noticed had they not demand I withhold that information and misrepresent the data). 

If you go to a for-profit college you’re being scammed there’s really no argument
Comment (11): Her friends need bigger boats too
Comment (12): Time to put this shit bird in prison.  My very Republican parents think she’s fucking horrible even.  Fuck her.
Comment (13): She is a total piece of shit. Hopefully she will burn in Hell.
Comment (14): Is it any surprise?  When the Republicans told us they were against the existence of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau "on principle", they openly told the nation they support corruption and the scamming of **you**.

To the right, fraud is a legitimate business and shutting it down is not in their interests.
Comment (15): If a judge already ruled against her and fined her department and she still doesnt get it, throw her ass in jail.
Comment (16): Wasn’t she just fined for this?
Comment (17): Those colleges are her friends.
Comment (18): She is such scum. Greedy, opportunistic, grasping, ignorant, arrogant, scum.
Comment (19): She is worse than Umbridge.
Comment (20): Devos was born rich has never even felt any kind of money problems ever in her whole life.   She views working class people like a farmer views cattle...their property.
Comment (21): Lock her up
Comment (22): I put in mine over a year ago and still haven't heard anything. They were in deferment after I filed, then after that deferment date expired they said I had an amount due, like $300 or something like that then they said my deferment was approved and now I wait again I guess. In the mean time I was fired so I have zero dollars to pay for the lie. Sue me I guess. I had to sell my truck to pay for bankruptcy. Zero major assets, right where they want us or else this shit wouldn't even be a thing.
Comment (23): Simon says arrest her.  She was ordered by a judge to forgive those loans, and is defying the judge's order.
Comment (24): Isnt this a crime? Are we going to do anything about that?
Comment (25): Her husband made money off of people with the Amway scam she sees scams as a legitimate way to earn wealth.
Comment (26): How much does Betsy DeVos stand to make from this *unlawful* decision of hers? It is will-known that she is involved in the for-profit education sector up to her eyeballs.
Comment (27): I don't know how americans aren't rioting in the streets.
Comment (28): That doesn't surprise me, she wants to make sure her family gets paid.
Comment (29): And so now it’s legal for business to commit fraud if the victims are just students?
Comment (30): Just came here to say that Devos is a truly awful person.
Comment (31): I'm not shocked. She's probably a shareholder on some of them. Par for the course in the most corrupt administration we've ever had. Hopefully, meanginful changes come from all this misery
Comment (32): Fascists out! 2020
Comment (33): Lock her up, lock her up?
Comment (34): I think it's time to worry. Maybe even organize.
Comment (35): You know, like a crime.
Comment (36): I was appalled to find out she is worth $2 billion
Comment (37): The thing I don't understand is _why_?
Comment (38): Directly to jail for her!
Comment (39): Sue the education department for gross negligence and punitive damages, and demand the removal of deVos.
Comment (40): "Executive branch secretary refuses to administer the law."

Why is this so hard?
Comment (41): And how does this benefit the American people exactly? Oh right, by fucking them over.
Comment (42): Fucking scum. I cannot wait until Betsy is out of that position. It’s like having Satan at heaven’s gate or something. She shouldn’t be allowed to speak for any educator.
Comment (43): People in contempt of court are generally thrown in prison until they comply.
Comment (44): Didn't she already lose several court battles and get personally fined for this?

"How many times do we have to teach you this lesson old woman!"
Comment (45): Lock her up. Lock her up.
Comment (46): You mean places like Trump University?
Comment (47): She’s a piece of dog shit, I hope she breaks her ankle.
Comment (48): Isn't there an order from a judge to forgive the debt?  If so, she needs to be arrested. 

Also, what the fuck is her problem?? Forgive the god damn debt. 

What a heartless, evil piece of shit.
Comment (49): Blame the politicians who let her get affirmed.  This could have been blocked, and they let it go through.  Everyone knew she was scum.
Comment (50): What a ruthless b.
Comment (51): Sink her boat to the bottom.
Comment (52): Lock her up (for contempt)
Comment (53): Ok. Take it from her Amway dragon hoard of ill-begotten gains and repay those she is refusing. If it her money, she'll actually give a shit about the situation.
Comment (54): Can’t forgive that debt. How will they offered to give multi-million dollar tax breaks to mega rich yacht owners?
Comment (55): What is the matter with this woman? Has she no empathy for America’s students?
Comment (56): Please put her behind bars.
Comment (57): Time for jail.
Comment (58): she was fined 100,000 the taxpayers had to pay it
Comment (59): Actually wow.
Comment (60): I do not understand why.  Ridiculous choice of a hill to die on.
Comment (61): Arrest her. Simple.
Comment (62): Who appointed her...  Oh, yeah.... the traitor, trump.
Comment (63): What the fuck is going on in this country?!
Comment (64): Shocking.
Comment (65): And we will all refuse to forgive Devos for being an absolute piece of shit.

Hopefully everywhere she goes in public after this she is sneered at and never has a quiet public moment again.
Comment (66): I wouldn’t be surprised if she profited off of those students. She’s already heir to a pyramid scheme, why should we expect her to not scam people?
Comment (67): She belong to genus homo sapiens? Hard to believe.
Comment (68): Looking at her staffers response reminded me of Veep so hard they way they SHOOK their heads and muttered "no...no..."
Comment (69): Please vote
Comment (70): She is such a piece of shit
Comment (71): What a vile piece of shit.  Throw her in prison.
Comment (72): Why? How does this personally impact her one way or the other?
Comment (73): I went to a Devos owned college in Grand Rapids. I couldn’t be more disappointed with the education I received.  The family is a bunch of greedy crooks in my opinion.
Comment (74): In Maryland, you cannot hold an executive level position that regulates an industry which you are involved. GD federal government.

Edit: I assume most states have the same ethics regulations.  How the fuck was she allowed to get this position? Of course look at Trump’s conflicts.
Comment (75): Hey guys, remember the French Revolution?  those seemed like fun times, right?
Comment (76): Devos is a fucking greedy monster.
Comment (77): ILLEGALLY is missing from this headline. VIOLATING THE LAW also works.
Comment (78): Crooks just being, and protecting other crooks.
Comment (79): I went to an art school that changed names and ownership three times while I was there. Almost none of the credits would transfer and I basically had to start class all over to get my AA at another school. Also the classes at the time cost $400 per credit hour, with each class being 3 credits, and taking less than 5 classes at a time was not allowed. 

Devos is literally helping people like this.
Comment (80): Wasn't she ordered to do so by Congress? Or was it the WH? Either way, she is clearly disobeying an order. She should be removed from office immediately.
Comment (81): I imagine her saying something like: “Let them eat cake.”
Comment (82): ELI5 please. Why are people like this still allowed to use our oxygen?
Comment (83): maybe that would piss off enough of people to persecute the for profit colleges
Comment (84): Thanks capitalism!
Comment (85): In any normal administration Betsy would have been forced to resign ages ago.
Comment (86): Merica, home of the brave land of the corrupt
Comment (87): Well. Of course.
Comment (88): She’s a piece of work isn’t she?
Comment (89): She hasn't moved on a single case. Meanwh she is illegally collecting on over 200,000. I could scream.
Comment (90): Of course. That's what she's been paid and instructed to do.
Comment (91): ""All one had to do was raise his or her hands to be entitled to so-called free money." When she had to sign off on thousands of old claims, DeVos added three words below her signature - with extreme displeasure." Free money - like the kind you married into, right?
Comment (92): The best people!
Comment (93): Is any of this related to Trump university?
Comment (94): We are seeing the effects of living in an Aristocracy now. Servitude is what they want; defiance is what they shall get.
Comment (95): Congress needs to investigate her as well. Find the inevitable self-dealing she’s involved in, and impeach Devos. Hell, I bet she’d be smart enough to resign if they just announced an investigation.
Comment (96): It's so nice of her to keep screwing the ones that already got screwed by a screwed up system and cannot even afford a screw and can't imagine being anything but askew. Hate her and ITT and myself thinking I'd be able to do the only thing I love for a career and found a school that promised to teach me those skills.
Comment (97): Instead of a fine the judge should threaten a judgment of blanket forgiveness of all 200k loans if she refuses to comply in good faith.
Comment (98): Why is this not the responsibility of the colleges to pay? Don’t understand how it’s on the government
Comment (99): Davenport University
Comment (100): Lock her up.
Comment (101): Until the last dollar has been taken from the private institutions and stakeholders that profited from this scheme, the government (and therefore tax payers) shouldn't be on the hook.
Comment (102): Who’s going to break her legs?
Comment (103): millenials getting screwed over by boomers. so much winning
Comment (104): Democrats are giant pussies that won’t enforce the laws

GOP will just keep ignoring subpoenas as they know nothing will come of it
Comment (105): Shouldn’t the for profit colleges have to pay this? I don’t see why the loan supplier should be on the hook?
Comment (106): If students were defrauded by a private college then it's a criminal case and they have the right to take it to court. Why would the government forgive the debt? So the college can get away with fraud?
Comment (107): As someone who got suckered into taking loans out for one of those schools that got shut down over this, I can honestly say that seeing other people get bailed out of the same situation I put myself in after I had to repay my loans (which I’m not getting reimbursed for) would feel like a giant slap in the face. But all the people that didn’t bother to repay their debts are gonna get theirs, so fuck me, right? I mean, that’s what Bernie supporters accuse me of saying when I don’t want my tax dollars going towards paying other people’s student loans.
Comment (108): Good, maybe next time don't just throw money at any cheap-ass college.
Comment (109): I just came here to declare how impressed I am that this subreddit is capable of running ONE SINGLE headline that doesn't have something to do with trump or peachmints. We did it Reddit!
Comment (110): You know how you says “in bed” after reading the fortunes in fortune cookies. All of these headlines should end in “and the Dems did nothing.”

Comment (1): Isn't that entirely counter to the structure of the program..?
 
Yeah.
> Immigrants are ineligible for the program if they have been convicted of a felony, a significant misdemeanor, or three or more misdemeanor offenses. They also cannot be deemed a threat to national security or public safety.
Comment (2): "That's false."

The GOP: But-but he's the God King! He's always right! He can't do or say anything wrong. 

Me: Sighs.
Comment (3): To the GOP, they're much worse than criminals. They're brown people.
Comment (4): He knows it's true because Stephen Miller said so.
Comment (5): He's nothing but a pathological liar and a racist hatemonger... oh, and a global laughingstock, a criminal, and a traitor who brags about sexual assault, spends charity money on a giant portrait of himself and ridicules the disabled and prisoners of war.
Comment (6): Each time I try to have a discussion with someone about DACA they can never point to hard evidence that DACA is bad for America. Instead they deflect and come up with some hyperbole that only shows they know nothing. It always ends with them saying DACA is unconstitutional. That’s they’re only argument and no court has held DACA as being unconstitutional. I don’t understand why people are so bent on getting rid of DACA without any major solution in sight for many of these Americans.
Comment (7): LITERALLY the 1st requirement for DACA is a pristine criminal record, you know nothing bag of diarrhea covered dildos.
Comment (8): The Trump family is a crime family, I'd call them hardened but they all seem pretty soft. Doughy even.
Comment (9): Sounds like an opinion. A racist one.
Comment (10): Facts, numbers, statistics? No just bullshit to further his hate platform.
Comment (11): I keep going back to what Trump once said to Billy Bush about telling bald-faced lies: "Billy, look, look, you just tell them and they believe it." That's how dumb he thinks his followers are. What makes it a ridiculous clown show is that Trump isn't a very bright person himself.
Comment (12): The known racist donald trump said something racist?
Comment (13): This is more racist red meat for the base.
Comment (14): My best friend's two siblings are Dreamers.  One is a defense lawyer and the other is a veteran who did multiple tours in Iraq.  Both are better Americans than I'll ever be.
Comment (15): And even if they were, they grew up in the United States...
Comment (16): Even someone with passing knowledge of the DACA program knows this isn't true. JFC.
Comment (17): Conservatives are scared to death of brown people (and pretty much anyone else who doesn't match their demographic profile).
Trump says stuff like this because he knows he can exploit his base's irrational emotions.
He doesnt care if it's true because hes trump.
He doesn't care if he he hurts innocent people because he is still trump..
Comment (18): Republicans are hardened criminals.
Comment (19): Aren't all brown peoples, amiright?!
Comment (20): But no one in the Trump administration is a DACA recipient. Confused!
Comment (21): That’s funny, I’d say the same thing about Trump and his cronies.
Comment (22): He meant black, or brown. To him the terms hardened criminal and not white are the same.
Comment (23): As opposed to soft, white collar criminals who don't even have the fortitude to fire his own people. Even if this bullshit statement were remotely true, I would entrust my life to any random Dreamer over this shit stain of a human being that we have the displeasure of calling President.
Comment (24): What on earth is he talking about? Does he have any idea what this program is? You have to maintain a good character to be in DACA--no criminal record, &c. Trump is an actively malignant actor who needs to be removed from office.
Comment (25): The only honest statements he's made have been about wanting to fuck his daughter.

And endless admission of crimes, I suppose.
Comment (26): Most of them are children... Trump is being racist again.
Comment (27): > Donald Trump says some DACA recipients are ‘very tough, hardened criminals.’ That’s ~~False~~  **A LIE**

**LIE**.

He's lying.

use the fucking correct goddamned words.
Comment (28): Why do we continue to fact-check that asshole? He's an unrepentant pathological liar - the surprise of the day would be that he ever told the truth.
Comment (29): When I read “Donald Trump says...”, I just automatically replace it with “Donald Trump made up some bullshit...”

Jaded? Yes. Justified? Yes, and a long time ago. Anything he says is wrong or a lie or just another attempt to deflect away from his multiple crimes in office
Comment (30): The Politifact scorecard currently looks like [this](https://i.imgur.com/1JkQii8.png) for Donald Trump.

To put it another way, of all the statements by Trump that have been examined by Politifact, 29% are Half True or better.

To put it *another* way, **85% of everything Donald Trump has said has been** ***Half False*** ***OR WORSE.***
Comment (31): What a racist old asshole.
Comment (32): Why bother fact checking? His supporters can’t read.
Comment (33): A lot of people are saying that the president is a limp-dicked criminal. 

Very soft.

The limpest.
Comment (34): Some US Presidents are very tough, hardened criminals.
Comment (35): Even if so. Does the few represent them? More than some trump supporters are very rough white supremacists....
Comment (36): I'd venture to guess Trump's administration has committed more crimes than DACA recipients
Comment (37): Using Trips very own logic when he is inevitably **ACQUITTED** by his accomplices in the house, he will be considered "A very hardened criminal".
Comment (38): It's pretty sad to see Trump do this now. In 2017 when he proposed ending the program he always made sure to express his support for the Dreamers and make it clear he was not in favor of their deportation. I don't know why he's now backtracking off of that stance. Maybe he's worried about how his often racist base would react to keeping the DACA program intact. Who knows. Horrible to see regardless.
Comment (39): In my experience a high percentage of the words that follow "Donald Trump says" are false.
Comment (40): I guess it takes a hardened criminal to identify another
Comment (41): They must be very scary people.
Comment (42): The criminals here are mob boss Twunk and his GOP mafia. Corrupt and rapidly embracing fascism.
Comment (43): My sister's boyfriend is a DACA recipient. He's a weedy little IT major. I'm pretty sure even I could beat him up, and that's saying a lot.
Comment (44): Donald  “pants-on-fire” Trump
Comment (45): Are there, statistically, some DACA recipients who have committed crimes?  Sure.  In any sufficiently large group, some members of it very likely committed crimes.  However, rather than using that as a justification to scrap the entire thing, how about deal with just those who broke the law?  

Like, say, Presidents.  Out of the 45 of them, surely some have been (or are) criminally corrupt.  Rather than scrapping the Presidency altogether, we should just impeach, remove from office, and convict those who are guilty of such criminal corruption, on top of being an ignorant, racist, narcissistic embarrassment to our entire country.
Comment (46): As if we didn't need more proof that Trump is a racist piece of fucking trash.  He just wants these people gone.  He would get rid of every brown person in the country if he legally could.
Comment (47): So is he saying he thinks they'd be a good fit for the white house?
Comment (48): I generally ignore the idiot - and in this case don't care - but it could be true just based on law of averages. You would think one or two slipped through the screening.
Comment (49): I have daca and my only “crimes” have been driving with out a license and Insurance due to not having the privilege of having a license. And a drunken disorderly because we tried to break up a fight. I have to report that to INS when I first applied for daca and have to report every other interactions with police on my record. Failure to do that can cause me to lose daca. 

Every two years I have to apply for daca and pay INS almost $500 to renew my daca and I have to have a background check and get a biometric scan done. That’s more than any American citizen does in their entire life time.

One thing I want to make very clear is that the reason why daca is important to me is because there is no “line” to become a permanent resident.
Comment (50): Where have I heard this before??? 

>They’re bringing drugs, they’re bringing crime, they’re rapists, and some, I assume, are good people.

Oh yeah, it was that one guy they said would turn into a decent human after he was made leader. I wonder what ever happened with that anyway.
Comment (51): Trump's kids are very tough, hardened criminals.

Fixed it for you.
Comment (52): But he said it.  And now thousands of morons believe it and dislike immigrants even more.
Comment (53): More like his associates are  ‘very tough, hardened criminals.’ That’s true.
Comment (54): So much fucking projection I can’t take it
Comment (55): More flat out lies...
Comment (56): The rule of large numbers *demands* that be the case.

The issue is that nobody is asking "how many?" And "is it more than the percentage of tough, hardened criminals among the general population?"

You can find an example of damn near anything in damn near any class, provided the class is large enough. So case study doesn't actually say anything.

Further, this is only an argument to stop providing DACA benefits to them, something we already do
Comment (57): Claim:  "Later, Trump also tweeted: "DACA recipients with arrest records: 53,792! That is a very large proportion of the total.""

Truth: "The government also provided data on approximately 889,000 people who applied for DACA. Of this group, 53,792 (the number Trump tweeted) had an arrest before their application was approved."

Conclusion: **TRUE**.

"very tough, hardened criminals" is an opinion, not a fact to be checked.
Comment (58): Do you think the folks at Politifact have a macro for the sentence: "We rate Trump's claim false."
Comment (59): See, this is the issue I have with these 'fact checks'. They are heavily biased (one way or the other).

The "fact" Trump tweeted was ""DACA recipients with arrest records: 53,792! That is a very large proportion of the total.""  That fact is TRUE.

"very tough, hardened criminals" is an *opinion*. You can't 'fact check' an opinion.
Comment (60): > She is a Do Nothing Democrat as Speaker, and will hopefully not be in that position very long. Approve USMCA, which has been sitting on her desk for months!

Wait wasn't he expected to sign DACA bills and shutdown the ICE camps and mistreatment of accused-foreigners ? i believe he has to sign that first if he wants USMCA (and i can't remember everything else, maybe she or sanders/aoc remembers the progressive wishlist)
Comment (61): Are we really expecting him to tell the truth about anything at this point?!
Comment (62): Another Trump lie.  I'm just amazed that the rate of Trumps lies and distortions haven't broken politicalfact.com and its meter.
Comment (63): At this point it would be more interesting to track the President factual statements. 

I’m already aware everything the man says is a lie.
Comment (64): Liar in chief.
Comment (65): Everything he says is either a lie or bullshit.
Comment (66): Even though Trump was trying to race bait,I am not sure how you can "fact check" any vaguely worded statement that used the adjective "some".  If I said some people named Bob smell like tuna fish and only 4 out of 10,000 Bob's smelled like tuna my statement wouldn't be very ethical.It  also would indicate I am trying to smear a bunch of people named Bob and give the impression those named Bob smelled like Tuna,but it wouldn't be a lie or false statement either.
Comment (67): [Here are some facts ](https://www.aier.org/article/the-facts-about-immigration-and-crime/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIlq37ipzr5QIVjZOzCh0e9wsHEAAYASAAEgJuFfD_BwE)
Comment (68): So are small portions of native-born ethnicities including whites.  While the admin is trying to put the brakes on illegal immigration (despite being so clownish, they couldn’t pull it off when R’s controlled both houses of Congress), ... I think the DACA types who’ve grown up in the US should stay, ... if only to prevent people with American accents and mannerisms from going overseas; possibly to start companies perhaps defrauding the US or even acting with foreign intelligence agencies.   

Everyone has to eat to put food on the table .... let’s not make almost a million American accented people desperate enough to try to the above.

So, here's some news articles and statistics showing that there exists some DACA recipients that have committed violent crimes, including murder and rape. Some are repeat offenders, which means they are hardened criminals. Snopes is shit and can't even be bothered to do a 1 minute Google search.
Comment (70): I don't think "some" means what you think it means. If you want to imagine that "some" is an integer above "50,000," then I understand why you agree with "false."
Comment (71): [Almost 8-percent of total DACA requestors (59,786 individuals) had arrest records](https://www.uscis.gov/news/new-data-shows-criminal-arrest-histories-daca-requestors)

[According to USCIS, 2,130 DACA recipients from fiscal year 2013 through 2017 had their eligibility terminated due to criminal or gang activity](https://www.factcheck.org/2019/11/the-data-on-daca-and-crime/)

I knew this way back when Obama was forcing his shit on america, HE wanted criminals living in the country.
Comment (72): Really? What’s [this](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.washingtonexaminer.com/washington-secrets/illegal-alien-charged-with-triple-murder-was-a-dreamer%3f_amp=true) then?
Comment (73): Trump 2020 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Comment (74): More lies from a partisan "fact" checking site.

Regardless of your position on Trump and immigration, Surely you guys can see through this nonsense propaganda. 

The idea that not even some DACA recipients are criminals is absurd. Rating that statement definitively "False" is a bad joke.
Comment (75): He said some DACA recipients, and who are you to say that's false have you talked to every single DACA recipient on the planet? And even if you have how can you be sure they are all telling the truth? Idiot poster
Comment (76): So most of the article is about how felons can’t get DACA which isn’t relevant as Trump was talking about those already under DACA. Trump said “some are...” and the article then mentions that of the 2100 or so that have been removed from DACA - meaning just the ones caught and convicted of criminal behavior - around 70 were for gang-related violence. 70 people is “some” of 660,000 people, right? Yet this is False? Politifact enjoys being nuanced when it suits the narrative but only until they take on something that is technically true to the quote under check.

Comment (1): It was witness tampering in plain sight, and it surely will become a new article of impeachment.
Comment (2): Yep. Add that to the impeachment articles please.
Comment (3): That's what a whole lot of us were saying back when the intimidation actually occurred.  Fuckin' A.  There were several threads on r/politics that discussed Trump's stochastic terrorism and direct intimidation.
Comment (4): Yep. Likely to be yet another article of impeachment.
Comment (5): c'mon /r/politics stop reading just the headline before commenting.  This is an MSNBC link...about Nicole Wallace.  Not about Chris Wallace and FOX News.
Comment (6): I like Chris Wallace. He's working for Trump's personal propaganda TV, but he isn't afraid to speak his mind. If he's interviewing someone he asks hard questions and tries to hold them accountable. I respect that.

I sure do miss Shepard Smith...

I wonder how long his non-compete is?
Comment (7): That makes two FOX anchors saying this line (him and Bret Baier). I think the tide may actually be turning.
Comment (8): Wallace deserves a lot of credit for going against his bosses and actually stating painful truths. I hope he can keep his job.
Comment (9): I don't agree a lot with Wallace on many issues but he has proven time and again that he is a sound-minded and logical individual. A very rare breed at FOX.

He did a fantastic job moderating the debate.

Comment (1): For someone with nothing to hide, Trump is sure going to an awful lot of trouble hiding things.
Comment (2): # Friendly reminder that he's been claiming he’ll release his tax returns for 8+ years now...

▶️**April 19, 2011**: In an interview with ABC News, Trump pledges to release his tax returns once President Obama releases his long-form birth certificate:

>”Maybe I'm going to do the tax returns when Obama does his birth certificate," Trump said in an interview with ABC. “I may tie my tax returns, **I'd love to give my tax returns, I may tie my tax returns into Obama's birth certificate.**"

▶️**April 27, 2011**: Obama releases long-form [birth certificate](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/blog/2011/04/27/president-obamas-long-form-birth-certificate).  No Trump tax returns.

▶️Also **April 27, 2011**: While contemplating a run in the 2012 Republican primary, Trump tells ABC News’ Michael Falcone that he will release his tax returns “at the appropriate time.”:

>”That’s something I would be thinking about doing anyway. That is certainly something I’d be thinking about doing anyway. But before I do anything I have to make the decision in June and **the first thing I’m going to be releasing will be financials**,” Trump said.  
>  
>Falcone asked again, will you fulfill that pledge that you made where you said I’m going to tie the birth certificate to my tax records?  
>  
>“Yeah, at the appropriate time,” Trump responded.  
>  
>“So you’ll do it?”  
>  
>“**Yeah, at the appropriate time I’m going to do it**,” Trump told him.

▶️**January 18, 2012**: On Fox News, Trump says Mitt Romney should release his tax returns:

>GRETA VAN SUSTEREN: Has Governor Romney been boxed on this tax return thing, and if he called you up tonight and said, Donald, ‘What should I do about tax return thing, should I release them or not?’  
>  
>TRUMP: I think first answer would have been good. It should have been delivered a certain way. **But April 1st historically is the time that everybody gives them**.

▶️**January 30, 2012**: Again commenting on Romney’s campaign, Trump tells Fox News that releasing your tax returns is “a great thing.”:

>BRIAN KILMEADE: When you see some of the analysis on Mitt Romney’s tax records, would that be a repellent for you, for Donald Trump to reveal everything?  
>  
>TRUMP: **I actually think that it’s a great thing when you can show that you’ve been successful, and that you’ve made a lot of money, that you’ve employed a lot of people. I actually think that it’s a positive**.”

▶️**May 2014**: Trump says that if he runs for office, he will “absolutely” release his tax returns, in an interview with Ireland’s TV3:

>COLETTE FITZPATRICK: You questioned his \[Obama’s\] citizenship during his campaign, and you said afterwards if he produced that long-form birth certificate, you’d produce your tax returns. But you didn’t do it, did you?  
>  
>TRUMP: Well I don’t know, did he do it? **And if I decide to run for office, I’ll produce my tax returns, absolutely and I would love to do that**.

▶️**February 25, 2015**: Trump tells conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt that he has “no objection” to releasing his tax returns:

>HUGH HEWITT: Would you release tax returns, though?  
>  
>TRUMP: **I would release tax returns**, and I would also explain to people that as a person that’s looking to make money, you know, I’m in the business of making money until I do this. And if I won, I would make money for our country. \[…\] So the answer is yeah, I would do it. \[…\]  
>  
>HEWITT: How many years back would you go on the day you announce? Three? Five?  
>  
>TRUMP: Oh, I don’t know. I mean, I actually have not even thought of that, but **I would certainly show tax returns if it was necessary**.

▶️**October 4, 2015**: On ABC’s This Week, Trump says he will release his tax returns once Hillary Clinton releases her emails:

>GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: Getting any closer to releasing your tax returns?  
>  
>TRUMP: Well, I’m thinking about it. **I’m thinking about maybe when we find out the true story on Hillary’s emails**. You know, I’ve been saying that for a while, let’s find out the true stories.  
>  
>STEPHANOPOULOS: Yes, that’s been your line, but she’s been putting some out.  
>  
>TRUMP: **But you know what? I’m very honest with my tax returns**.

▶️**January 24, 2016**: On NBC’s Meet the Press, Trump says that his campaign is “working on” releasing his tax returns:

>CHUCK TODD: Will you release any of your tax returns for the public to scrutinize?  
>  
>DONALD TRUMP: Well, we’re working on that now. **I have very big returns, as you know, and I have everything all approved and very beautiful and we’ll be working that over in the next period of time**, Chuck. Absolutely.  
>  
>...  
>  
>TRUMP: I pay, it’s a little tax. And I say it. And the reporters said, “That’s the most refreshing answer I’ve ever heard on taxes,” because everyone tries to build it up \[…\] **We’re working on it right now, and at the appropriate time, you’ll be very satisfied.**

▶️**February 10, 2016**: Trump tells NBC News that he will release his tax returns over the next few months:

>MATT LAUER: Real quickly. When are you going to release your tax returns?  
>  
>TRUMP: **Probably over the next few months**. They’re being worked on now.

▶️**February 19, 2016**: IRS says Trump can release tax returns, regardless of audit.

▶️**Rest of 2016 - 2019**: 'Can’t, audits.'

And now it’s going all the way to the Supreme Court.  8 years of him claiming he'd release them, and yet he's fighting tooth and nail to keep them concealed.  I'm beginning to think this Trump fellow isn't entirely truthful.

Trump’s Long Trail of Litigation

https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-long-trail-of-litigation-1457891191
Comment (4): Long way from releasing them when the phantom "audit" is over...Supreme Court will have to decide if we still live in a democratic republic.
Comment (5): The title assumes they take it up. I think it’s more likely they deny cert (decline to take it up) and let the current ruling stand.
Comment (6): This is the opposite of releasing them, like he promised..
Comment (7): "I cAn'T reLeASe mY tAxES wHilE I'm beINg ~~aUdiTEd~~ iMpeACheD!"
Comment (8): I look forward to the Twitter tirade when he loses.
Comment (9): Trump is easily the most litigious president in history and possibly in American history as a civilian.  Litigation is a business tool for him to be used as a shield to defend his unethical modus operandi. But he does lose his ass in court. The charade called "Trump University" cost him $25 million in court.
Comment (10): Whatever he's hiding, it's really big.
Comment (11): No downside here. It's an extremely weak case. If he wins, it confirms again that the Supreme Court is a wholly owned subsidiary of the GOP and in dire need of reform. If he loses, we get to see what he's been taking great pains to conceal.
Comment (12): For any conservatives cheering for this, this would set a Precedent that would shield ALL Presidents going forward for corrupt acts.

You sure you cool with not being allowed to investigate the financial dealings of a Democrat President? Because I'm not cool with that regardless of party.
Comment (13): My guess is that the court won’t take on the case and let the current ruling stand.
Comment (14): No way they take the case. They wouldn't take the chance of setting the precedent that a president can't be investigated.
Comment (15): He's been laundering Russian and Saudi money for decades through real estate.

Additionally, he inflates the numbers for the banks and deflates the number for taxes.    

It's tax fraud pure and simple.   Likely hasn't paid any taxes in decades.
Comment (16): Trump is doing a pretty good audit of the checks and balances of the United States branches of government. If this was ISO 27001 it would be a massive FAIL.
Comment (17): He's literally asking the Supreme Court to stop him from keeping his campaign promise of showing his tax returns after the 2016 campaign was over. Still waiting after three years, even on something he has complete control over.
Comment (18): Who paid off Brett Kavanaugh's credit card debt and mortgage and bought themselves a Supreme Court judge?
Comment (19): Definitely something an innocent person would do. Nothing to hide at all.
Comment (20): Not a lawyer, but I predict that SCOTUS will refuse to hear the case, leaving the lower courts ruling to stand, which for anyone else means that the tax returns must be released.

...BUT...Trump’s legal team and his Fox News lackeys will push the narrative that somehow the law works different for the president; the Supreme Court refusing to hear the case somehow instead means that the whole case is invalid, so his tax returns don’t have to be released.

And the GOP will do nothing, so just like on everything else, and he’ll get away with ignoring a courts legal orders.
Comment (21): Trump is a desperate loser. How the fuck do people still buy his brand of bullshit. My god
Comment (22): I've never seen someone who claims to be innocent hide the evidence that proves their innocence.
Comment (23): This guy is pure cancer to our democracy.
Comment (24): >In the filing at the Supreme Court, Trump’s lawyers said that upholding the subpoena would unleash the president’s political enemies.

That sounds like a you problem there bud
Comment (25): He's a public servant, those records are vital to understand his allegiance. If he owes other countries billions of dollars he is understandably compromised. Even more so since he hasn't relinquished control of his business.
Comment (26): What's the percentage of people in the IRS that looked at the tax returns just because they could
Comment (27): The moment of truth arrives. Will the Supreme Court act in support of the constitutional separation of powers, or act along partisan factions?
Comment (28): Kinda strange how much effort he spends on blocking something he said he'd do and Presidents routinely do. So weird!
Comment (29): Trump inherited a staggeringly huge fortune from his crooked Billionaire father and if he had put it in a safe secure index fund, he’d now be worth over 67 Billion. Instead he grossly mismanaged this fortune, lost billions of other people’s money and most of his own. He knows if the truth gets out he’s going to be a global laughing stock.
Comment (30): Lmao imagine telling a Trump voter in 2016 that he would escalate a lawsuit over handing his tax returns all the way up to the supreme court.
Comment (31): Can we just take a moment to appreciate that Trump swore up and down that he'd release his tax returns during the election and is now using the *Supreme Fucking Court* to try to block anyone seeing them?
Comment (32): Always remember: Anthony Kennedy made this possible
Comment (33): It’s 2019. I still cannot believe that Donald fucking Trump will forever be in the pictures alongside George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. Donald Trump. Who is a walking punchline, will HAVE to be taught in schools as one of the Presidents of the United States of America’s. At this point the only reason for supporting him are two things: racism and stupidity.
Comment (34): Innocent men do not go to these lengths to hide a payoff from Putin.
Comment (35): One he's an on paper billionaire that's hocked up to his eyebrows, two he's been gaming the system for years with sham paper losses to shelter profits.
Comment (36): Anybody remember when he said this?

“We're working on that now. I have big returns, as you know, and I have everything all approved and very beautiful and we'll be working that over in the next period of time”
- Donald J. Trump, January 24th, 2016
Comment (37): The question on everyone's mind should be:

**WHY IS TRUMP FIGHTING SO HARD TO KEEP HIS TAXES SECRET?**

With all the negative press they have generated, surely he would have released them by now if there was nothing to hide in them. He has been saying for years he would release them, but never did. Now that he's finally being forced to do it, he's throwing everything he can at it to avoid having them come out.

**WHY?**

Obviously, if they painted him as some successful businessman with everything legal and kosher, he would have released them long ago and kept pointing to them as a show of how great and wonderful he is. So obviously, there must be something in there that's very, very bad that he doesn't want anyone else to know about.
Comment (38): I feel like trump is more worried about this tax thing than he is about getting impeached. I think whatever is in there is impeachable by itself and will land him in prison for life along with a lot of other GOP.
Comment (39): Three years ago he said he would be releasing his returns “very soon”. Now he’s asking SCOTUS to block their release.

W T F!!!
Comment (40): Isn’t he the guy that said if he gets elected he’d voluntarily release his returns! Oh sorry, I got him confused with an honest person! 😩
Comment (41): At this point, the Supreme Court, a mostly red Supreme Court must decide whether to openly move to end America as we know it (setting off mass panic and likely a night of the long knives) or being American.

I'm not optimistic, especially with two picks placed there by a known traitor (Trump).
Comment (42): I'll be honest, I always thought the tax returns were a probable dead end and this has all just been him letting people waste their time. But you dont go to the supreme court to just hide your finances. There has to be some damning shit that the IRS did not report.

Meanwhile one of the non-royalty class just had their house seized and sold over less than $10 of unpayed taxes. Must be nice being rich.
Comment (43): Exactly the actions of an innocent man.
Comment (44): boy he really doesnt want to show them huh.. They that bad?
Comment (45): There must be some really incriminating evidence in there.
Comment (46): Why would they even hear this case? It's ridiculous.
Comment (47): I don’t have faith in the Sup(R)eme Court of Republican View of Law. The SCOTUS is no longer legitimate and has been bought by the donors of the Republican Party.
Comment (48): You know what’s truly frightening.  Trump gets 4 more years.  He could possibly appoint 3 more Supreme Court justices.  Just let that sink in,  trump getting to appoint 5 heavily partisan and corrupt Supreme Court judges.  Remind any “progressive” of that fact that even hints at protest voting if “x candidate doesn’t win the primary”
Comment (49): How messed up to you have to be to take down the Constitution, because you don’t want to be humiliated?
Comment (50): I cannot even slightly grasp the opposing argument here. If there is nothing shady about them then why fight so hard against releasing them?
Comment (51): Somebody really needs to leak them. Somebody totally patriotic; who sees this asshole for what he really is; a domestic enemy attacking the very foundations of United States constitutional law.
Comment (52): The argument that the sitting President cannot being investigated or charged with crimes reminds me of diplomatic immunity.     

Maybe Trump IS a Russian diplomat.
Comment (53): They won’t take the case and the courts decision will stand.  This is the last of this and he will finally be exposed.
Comment (54): Supreme court should just turn down the case.....let the lower court ruling stand.
Comment (55): I learned via divorce, if spouse refuses to fill out discovery, odds are they are hiding something.  Same here, refuse to show tax returns, we ALL know this is goldmine of holy shit.
Comment (56): If the Supreme Court blocks his tax return release, then we are a full blown dictatorship. The rule of law will mean nothing. We have the American right to rise ✊ Save for a November 2020 movement. Start saving NOW!
Comment (57): This is probably tho ONLY thing that will get him out of office. He can lock children up in cages, collude with foreign powers to win elections, abuse his role in office to funnel money into his enterprises....but his tax returns being combed over by Congress will be when he decides it’s too dangerous for him to remain a public official
Comment (58): I mean, if he even has to ask that, that should be raising red flags the size of Texas. Or Alaska. Whichever you feel inclined to think is bigger. ~~your mama, even?~~
Comment (59): The thought of the Supreme Court overruling lower courts and preventing Congress from seeking Trump's tax returns is literally making me sick to my stomach.
Comment (60): He's afraid that his base of like-minded business geniuses will find out what a poverty-stricken shyster he is.
Comment (61): Fuck Trump
Comment (62): Nixon lost.

Clinton lost.

Trump...

...well...

Um...

GET READY FOR FIREWORKS

>*The cases set up a potentially dramatic decision on presidential power like those the Supreme Court rendered against Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Bill Clinton. Both were unanimous rulings rejecting the their pleas, and suggest Trump might have trouble keeping the tax information from prosecutors and Congress.*

Yeah... he's gonna lose.
Comment (63): Any guess on when they'll make a decision one way or another?
Comment (64): US v Nixon establishes the limits of executive privilege.  Deny cert and let it stand
Comment (65): > Politically motivated subpoenas like this one are a perfect illustration of why a sitting president should be categorically immune from state criminal process

I'm OK with the president being immune to any and all indictments while in office as long as the statute of limitation does not apply for any crime comitted during or prior to their term as president and that could have been prosecuted during the time they were immune while in office.

However, there should be absolutely no limits on investigating the president. If Trump's finances are scandalous enough that it would legitimately cause him harm if the public got to see the details, then that's his fucking problem. He's the god damn president, and his behavior should be expected to be completely legal and honest in every aspect of his fucking life. It's a high standard, but he's the fucking president; I think it's entirely warranted. If Trump has been fucking with his finances and dodging taxes, we deserve to know.

A president shouldn't be indictable on any charges (while in office). The constitution gives us impeachment as the answer for a corrupt president. Investigating a president because there is reason to believe that he's a piece of shit who cheats on his taxes is absolutely kosher and if the supreme court blocks that, I'll personally drive to DC and shit on their rug.
Comment (66): When the fuck are Americans going to finally take to the streets?
Comment (67): Trump is the dumbest looking piece of shit in the whole world
Comment (68): This man almost certainly knows jack shit about the constitution or the laws of this country.

When shit hits the fan, every single lawyer that is advising him on how to justify his treasonous activities needs to be disbarred and imprisoned.
Comment (69): Why is Trump fighting so hard against one of his campaign promises?
Comment (70): The “most transparent president” and he’s fighting like hell to keep these away. Awesome
Comment (71): Why would an innocent man, who also promised to release his tax returns during the campaign fight tooth and nail to prevent that from happening?
Comment (72): It blows my mind that this quote is seen as a legitimate defense:
>“That the Constitution would empower thousands of state and local prosecutors to embroil the President in criminal proceedings is unimaginable,” they said in the filing. “State criminal process interferes with the President’s ability to execute his duties.”

It won't be an issue if the president doesn't engage in behavior that warrants investigation! And if they are engaged in questionable behavior, we should absolutely investigate them, like anyone else in our democracy.
Comment (73): Any political nominee should be made to have background checks, release their tax returns and divest themselves/their family from all business interests - if they fail any of the above then they should be blocked from running.
Comment (74): Well, it's a lucky thing the Republicans stole Merrick Garland's seat, and then weaseled their rapist frat boy onto the court.  An ounce of obstruction is worth a pound of honesty, or something like that.

It's worth noting that [every modern president since Nixon, with the exception of Gerald Ford, has released their tax returns as a gesture of good faith,](https://www.taxnotes.com/presidential-tax-returns) something Trump is incapable of making since he has none.
Comment (75): If the court protects Trump (they won't), it's time to take to the the streets.
Comment (76): JFC how bad are these tax returns?
Comment (77): Honestly, Trump making this request at all ought to invalidate the Supreme Court from ruling on this issue. Tampering with the judges. If it's not a law, it should be. Sorry, Donny, you'll have to live with what the previous court said — Fork 'em over.
Comment (78): Almost like he handpicked these fucks to shield him personally when all of his crimes and traitorous ways start coming out.
Comment (79): **Republicans on the Patriot Act -** "If you did nothing wrong, you have nothing to hide!"

**Republicans on Trump -** "We said what? I don't remember that."
Comment (80): What a fucking coward.
Comment (81): Nobody can pretend there's still a question about whether Trump's tax returns would prove him guilty of *something*... but I keep scratching my head and thinking "Who believes an innocent man goes to these lengths to hide information that would exonerate him?"
Comment (82): When this is all over and everything finally comes out Republicans are going to have a really hard time making themselves look good. All these people needlessly defending him. It's going to ruin some people.
Comment (83): I voted for Trump, I was wrong about this guy. Every day he has more and more shady dealings happening. He has embarrassed himself and our country with his stupid tweeting problem. I'm sorry that this guy is not the president I had hoped and wanted him to be. Hopefully we can get him out of office one way or another and restore sanity to this countries leadership.
Comment (84): Jeez.  You think the GOP would let a democratic president get away with this?  Such hypocrisy it's disgusting
Comment (85): Most transparent president ever!
Comment (86): If his taxes are as fucked up as all this resistance indicates, then the IRS has a lot of explaining to do.
Comment (87): Trumps legal team: "The president can't be investigated"

Liberatrians and conservatives who supposedly hate unchecked federal power have raging hard ons.
Comment (88): >separation-of-power

Uh, this isn't Executive vs Legislative vs Judicial. It's Executive vs rule of law. Shielding his taxes would literally make the President above the law.
Comment (89): “Politically motivated subpoenas like this one are a perfect illustration of why a sitting president should be categorically immune from state criminal process.”

Are you fucking kidding me!?!?!? This is exactly why they are not above the law! The president works for the people and therefore should 100% be able to be prosecuted against. If not then he wouldnt be a president, he'd be a dictator!
Comment (90): FFS, someone just LEAK THE TAX RETURNS! It doesn't matter if it's inadmissable evidence, the impeachment isn't a criminal trial and it's totally allowed to reference illegally obtained evidence.
Comment (91): lol showdown over some idiots stupid shady criminal dealings, haha - what a time to be alive. 

This is what conservative america thinks is a governing powerhouse? They lack any sense of leadership or inspiration, it's pathetic.
Comment (92): I wonder if he's more scared that he will be outed as a non-billionaire or as someone who doesn't pay his fair share like the rest of us.
Comment (93): And now we see why he packed the court with his nominations.
Comment (94): I'm not sure how this will play out, but I think we're making too big of a deal about the conservatives on the court being essentially yes-men for the GOP.  Kavanaugh and Thomas are absolute boot-lickers, I agree with that.  Alito is a pretty solid conservative, but he can be reasonable.  Roberts and Gorsuch are more principled conservatives.  They're going to lean to the right, but in the end I trust they'll usually put politics aside and come up with the right decision.
Comment (95): This man is fucked.
Comment (96): Whatcha got to hide Donnie?
Comment (97): I can understand why he wouldn't want to release them. Either there is embarrassing stuff he doesn't want people to know about in them, or he's worried (rightfully so) that entire groups will dedicate themselves to dissecting his tax forms in attempt to cause him grief and financial damage.

But he knew all that back when he was shooting off his mouth about his willingness to release them, so it's one of those moments where either put up or shut up.
Comment (98): Trump will do anything he can to waste taxpayer dollars, all the while claiming to be conservative. The Supreme Court should hold him in contempt for refusing this long.
Comment (99): Our president needs to do time
Comment (100): Good lord. I mean...what the fuck is in these tax returns? Seriously. Is it nothing but hooker expenses? The location of Jimmy Hoffa's body?
Comment (101): If he didn't have anything to hide he wouldn't care..  Nuff said...
Comment (102): How do trump supporters justify this? Whats Trump's reasoning?

Comment (1): Chris Wallace just said this to Fox News viewers:    

> “If you are not moved by the testimony of Ambassador Yovanovitch, you don't have a pulse."    

Ken Starr says this about Trump's tweet:   

> “Extraordinarily poor judgment. ... I think this was quite injurious. The President frequently says ‘I follow my instincts.'  Well, sometimes we have to control our instincts."   

Bret Baier says this:   

> That was a turning point in this hearing so far.  She was already a sympathetic witness & **the President’s tweet ripping her allowed Schiff to point it out real time characterizing it as witness tampering or intimidation -adding an article of impeachment real-time.**
Comment (2): Trump: “I know what will bolster my base: I’ll attack this witness in real time!”

*Everyone did not like that*

Trump: *surprisedpikachu.jpeg*
Comment (3): Fuck Fox News. Ken Starr is on there right now arguing about the tweet that JUST HAPPENED, saying that "we need to put it behind us" and move forward with exposing the impeachment for the sham it is. 

"You cant put lipstick on this…" actual quote about Trump's tweet that Ken Starr couldn't figure out how to finush
Comment (4): Fox news sounds a lot like MSNBC its stunning, I'm just giddy with excitement. commentary from Chris Wallace and Bret Baier totally changed the dynamic.
Comment (5): To be fair, Chris Wallace has frequently been critical of Trump. Most Trump supporters hate him.
Comment (6): Nah - they're just trying to sound a little lass hackish than Gym Jordan. Which is a pretty low bar.
Comment (7): Rupert Murdoch gave you this president. Fox anchors turning on Trump means nothing if Americans don't turn on Murdoch and his crass shrills.
Comment (8): Trump just cannot control himself. He cannot follow anyone ‘s advice. He thinks he knows absolutely everything. And he has the nuclear codes.
Comment (9): Yet there are representatives out there saying " of course he attacked her! He has to defend him self!" What world are they living in?
Comment (10): I wouldn't get used to it. I've seen them respond like this during an event quite a bit. They'll have their spin together in a little while.
Comment (11): And the first domino falls...
Comment (12): Add it to the pile!
Comment (13): Laughing so hard at Trump’s expense right now.
Comment (14): The tweet that broke the camel's back
Comment (15): > Chris Wallace similarly said on air during a break in the hearing: "If  you are not moved by the testimony of Marie Yovanovitch today, you don't  have a pulse." 

Hannity: You rang...
Comment (16): The tweet heard around the world. This will be in the history books.

Comment (1): The GOP has never cared about the truth. Their entire platform has always been based on lies and corruption.
Comment (2): Fiction can be more fun than the truth. I mean it truly is.

Of course, these hearings are non fiction, people often tell the truth, and can be entertaining. Just look up at moment when a Democrat asks Trump to testify ;) However, the important thing is: These hearings are not meant as entertainment. They are about serious fact finding. This is quite the opposite of entertainment.
Comment (3): Fox News came into its own during the Bush years when it helped spread lies about Iraq to assist Bush and Cheney's push for war. To this day, millions of Americans believe the lie that we found weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and that Saddam Hussein had something to do with 9/11. The mass death and suffering resulting from that war (that continues to this day) was a brilliant success for the network. Since then, Fox News has only gotten stronger. It offers the sweet, euphoric drug of confirmation bias to the American Right, crafting an alternate reality - an emotional safe space - for them to experience in front of their televisions.

This drug proved popular enough to boost the reach of other right-wing lie machines like Infowars and now One America News that manage to push easily-disprovable lies and bonkers conspiracy theories into the mainstream to the point that sitting lawmakers spout them off during hearings in the U.S. Congress.

Trump is just the inevitable product of the rise of these lie machines. With "fake news," the safe space became a fully mobile construct that right-wingers can carry with them at all times. Even when they see something with their own eyes in plain sight that counters their adoration for Dear Leader, the "fake news" safe space activates like an invisible force field, protecting them from emotional distress.

Now establishment Republicans have finally realized that they don't even have to manage even weak plausibility for false statements. They can just outright lie and their target audience will never know.
Comment (4): Bunch of losers
Comment (5): It must suck to be that stupid. 

Republicans can't get themselves out of a hole.
Comment (6): "Reality has a well known liberal bias."
Comment (7): also too much water or something
Comment (8): These are the bottom feeders, the swamp if you will, they should never be allowed to serve in our government. They can’t be honest about anything!
Comment (9): bUT hEr EmaILs!

**GOP are cowards, hypocrites, and traitors.**
Comment (10): “It’s unfair that facts have a strong liberal bias.”
Comment (11): You must admit the truth hinders the GOP brand of Governing!
Comment (12): They’ve done that forever.
Comment (13): Reality is often disappointing

Comment (1): Facebook is no longer attempting to hide which side it's on. They have thrown their lot in with the oligarchs and their lackeys.
Comment (2): The outcry is that judges like Kavanaugh are associated with the Federalist Society when they are supposed to be impartial. The fact that facebook sponsors it is just another disaster.
Comment (3): Why? We've already established that Facebook is evil. Stop using their services. Encourage others to stop. They're a terrible company from the top down.
Comment (4): Should we start calling them Fascistbook?
Comment (5): Everyone here crying out to delete Facebook should also include instagram.  If you have instagram you are still part of the problem.
Comment (6): Stop using Facebook
Comment (7): A few years ago on the Graham Norton show actress Miriam Margolyes stated that she hated the Social Network because they were all "utter arseholes". Turns out she was on the mark.
Comment (8): Fuck Facebook.
Comment (9): If you didn’t have enough reason to delete Facebook before, you should really start considering it now that they are openly becoming part of the right wing propaganda machine.
Comment (10): Zuckerberg is really embracing the super villain thing. Time to get all my friends to ditch FB and go somewhere else.
Comment (11): We know where the monsters live.
Comment (12): We shouldn't be surprised in Facebook's continued push into politics given they want to maintain their monopoly, lack of innovation in the past few years, and the purchasing of any potential competitor. 

Also, if you still have a Facebook account, at the very least delete the app from your phone.
Comment (13): Kavanaugh is a psychopathic misogynist who acts on his hate for women by raping them. And Facebook is totally cool with that, brah.
Comment (14): Brett Kavanaugh, the infamous Republican appointed second rapist of our SCOTUS along with Thomas, or some other Brett Kavanaugh?
Comment (15): The one thing missing here is the date and location of the event. It's almost as if they didn't want any uninvited guests.
Comment (16): So Elizabeth Warren wasn't lying with her fake ad, Zuckerberg really does support Trump and the Republicans.
Comment (17): Untucking believable with this shit.
Comment (18): It’s becoming clear that FB makes their living from the right wing, and they are gonna go further in that direction as time goes on.
Comment (19): But sure, Silicon Valley has a liberal bias...
Comment (20): Fuck Facebook! I wish I can delete that asshat app a thousand times over
Comment (21): This is truly a dangerous time for democracy and freedom worldwide.
Comment (22): Surveillance company purchasing supreme court, what could go wrong?
Comment (23): Fuck sides.  This is buying the Supreme Courts vote in the open.  It’s disgusting and sad that we have arrived at this place in our history with no real plan to get us out of the hole.  We have a recession coming and likely five more years of Trump to make us feel great the whole time.  It’s so depressing.
Comment (24): Face off.
Comment (25): Rapebook.

Comment (35): delete facebook
Comment (36): Fuck facebook and fuck the rapist that the GOP gave a SCOTUS seat.
Comment (37): When I left Facebook it was because they were suspiciously deleting several AJ pages of which I got the news from.

I had gotten fed up by the obvious right leaning slant where you can threaten to shoot up all black churches or break (democratic) politician's legs/threaten assassinations but if you post "men are trash" you can get your account suspended for "terroristic threats".

Not to mention their incredibly malicious participation in spreading propaganda in other countries, like Thailand and the Philippines.

Trying to point out this obvious disparity was a fools' errand of course, but I implore people to delete their facebooks immediately, and connect with people in other ways.  Not only out of moral principle, but out of your own security, since it is the number one resource for doxxing.

Facebook is just diet stormfront.
Comment (38): Facebook is being used as a distraction.  Wouldn’t surprise me if Putin is pulling their strings as well.  Putin is at war internally with us and his billionaire friends are all on board!
Comment (39): Well. Of course.
Comment (40): Delete your facebook now.
Comment (41): I'm surprised there isn't an exodus of engineers at Facebook.

Comment (44): I stopped using Facebook pretty much cold turkey about a year or so ago and haven’t looked back since. Mark Zuckerberg is of questionable morals and it’s too easy to data mine someone an FB profile.
Comment (45): This seems like something that shiiidnt be allowed to happen at all. It’s essentially bribery
Comment (46): Hey ladies aren't you glad you work at Facebook?
Comment (47): Boof Kavanaugh gets a rape medal.
Comment (48): Burt kavagrope is human trash
Comment (49): We all know the Zuck is preparing for a worst case scenario and he has to fight all the way to the SCOTUS to keep his power. Gotta butter up Boofin' Brats buns for a confirmed no vote from at least one or two justices
Comment (50): Facebook features this fart face.  They are made for each other. 👎
Comment (51): I have to admit deleting Facebook is gonna feel a little weird at first. Like I’m unplugging from the world.
Comment (52): Facebook sold themselves to trump
Comment (53): I’ve asked this before and gotten no response, but let me ask again: since Facebook has become evil, what alternatives are there?
Comment (54): Is Facebook's motto really just "be evil" now?
Comment (55): When do we burn Facebook to the ground? I’m free this weekend.
Comment (56): Facebook is trash
Comment (57): This is so depressing. Continuation of the slow motion right wing coup in broad daylight.
Comment (58): There is no ethical consumption under capitalism.
Comment (59): this thread is a conspiracy brigade. fb donated to a 501 and another favoring other policies. That is politics in the US. It needs to be reformed.
Comment (60): Facebook... the new Government Organized Propaganda News Network.

Also known as the GOP News Network.
Comment (61): Erasebook
Comment (62): I know this is prolly illegal but if some great American threatened every GOP member with a bullet to the head unless they voted for stricter gun laws... with a bullet to the head unless "prayers and condolences could stop the bullet.  ... met. If there is anything I've learned it's that the gop are seeking the best interests of foreign governments. I legitimately believe trump is gay
>Outcry after Facebook sponsors gala featuring Brett Kavanaugh
Comment (63): Delete your Facebook account.
Comment (64): "We have to do better"

~Mark Zuckerburg
Comment (65): I bet there was lots of beer at his gala!!
Comment (66): Zuckerburg hasn’t faced a single repercussion from his actions and he won’t until people en masses stop using Facebook and Instagram.
Comment (67): Facebook and Brett Kavanaugh: two useless yet somehow very successful things.
Comment (68): Facebook is becoming a blatant political company. Glad I deleted that trash.
Comment (69): Stop using their services then. Facebook is the easiest monster to kill but people are too lazy to find a different avenue for their social media obsession.
Comment (70): I've already removed everything Facebook from my life. Guess all I can do now is try to convince my friends and family to do the same.
Comment (71): My number one use for Facebook is events and hosting /RSVPing to parties. If someone created a lightweight app for that purpose it would be great.
Comment (72): Man, Facebook really is the enemy. I thought they were neutral evil, but they're actually openly hostile to democracy.
Comment (73): We all know what side FB and it’s head robot are on.
Comment (74): What the f does the government have on Zukerberg. He’s turning out to be an evil henchmen for the Republican Party.
Comment (75): Delete facebook.
Comment (76): Zuckerberg is preparing for a Republican presidential run. He's courting them. He doesn't seem to understand how this will destroy Facebook, but it's possible he realises this is their only path to survive the coming legal shitstorm.
Comment (77): How is this not illegal?
Comment (78): Facebook is trash. Friends don't let friends use Facebook.
Comment (79): Facebook makes it really hard for me to support any of their hardware. Why did they have to buy oculus god dammit.
Comment (80): Its easy to stop using facebook. I mean, keep protesting, but also stop using facebook.
Comment (81): Facebook is just adapting to better serve it's user base as it moves closer to being an irrelevant platform used primarily by old, white, ultraconservative conspiracy theorists.
Comment (82): What is the outcry? Just delete facebook.
Comment (83): Facrbook is now the propaganda arm of the right wing, corporatists, and foreign powers.  

It probably already was.
Comment (84): This is the part where we continue demonizing a guy who has never been shown to be guilty of a crime.
Comment (85): I really don’t why some ppl still insist in using FB with their record.
Comment (86): Zuck might as well purchase Gab at this point. What a greedy, pathetic POS.
Comment (87): I never noticed how much Brett looks like “Glenn” from the show Superstore ha
Comment (88): Zuckerberg: “Oh noooo...outcry. There’s outcry.”
Comment (89): Given that for most people quitting is not an option - everyone should use Facebook, Twitter and Reddit with VPN from I dunno Ukraine or something, or a rotating VPN. I think it might change their opportunistic behavior a dash.
Comment (90): Is there any alternative to FB out there?
Comment (91): This whole timeline is a shitshow.
Comment (92): Facebook believe it’s worth spending their money that way. 

Why do they believe that, I wonder?
Comment (93): Facebook is really leaning into this new "evil" public image they've gotten.
Comment (94): Facebook is desperately trying to become the Fox News of social media.
Comment (95): Could it be that Facebook is hedging its bets. There is very strong scrutiny of their privacy practices and litigation will likely reach the supreme court sometime in the future. Wouldn't it be more likely to win those if FB is viewed as right wing friendly?
Comment (96): How many people deleted their accounts though
Comment (97): Brett Kavanaugh the rapist? That guy?
Comment (98): Did Facebook live long enough to see itself become the villain?
Comment (99): Dropped Facebook years ago...Zuckerburg reminds me of Stephen Miller...evil and vile.
Comment (100): Can congress impeach Supreme Court justices?
Comment (101): Facebook doing this makes me ashamed of being a tech startup.
Comment (102): Facebook is a conservative propaganda tool
Comment (103): Delete fb now!!!
Comment (104): If you haven't deleted your facebook yet, you're part of the problem.
Comment (105): Mark sure is banking a lot on a generation that is going to be gone in about 30 years
Comment (106): Delete Facebook!!!
Comment (107): If Democrats win Congress and presidency in 2020, they should pass a  "Replace a Rapist" law that allows for appointing extra  Supreme Court justice when there are proven rapists on the court.
Comment (108): Delete Facebook
Comment (109): I deleted mine near the beginning of this mess and don't miss it at all. Try it! Don't be a tool for the evil.
Comment (110): Delete Facistbook! Is there a way to create an event like the Area 51 raid, only it's to delete facebook? I feel like it might get steam.
Comment (111): Seriously?
Comment (112): Does anyone else just use the memories feature to download old photos and delete posts? I’ve been doing this for a couple months now. Eventually I will have gone through everything and delete my entire account, but I have more than a decade of family pictures on there that I don’t have anywhere else. 

I very rarely post anything anymore or even visit. I used to enjoy keeping up with friends and family from back home but for the past few years I only see posts from the same 5 people mixed with a bunch of ads or group posts. Facebook is already dying, but their political slant is going to kill it off much more quickly.
Comment (113): I don't understand the source of the outcry.

* Brett Kavanaugh is a sitting US Supreme Court justice.
* He was properly nominated and confirmed per all legal requirements.
* There was an allegation of illegal conduct made against him, which was never substantiated and never resulted in any criminal charges or conviction.
* He's written no unusual judicial opinions and his voting record on the Supreme Court thus far is moderate and unremarkable.

Seems as though this outcry is coming from a segment determined to hate the man, regardless of any fact. I don't have any love for Brett Kavanaugh; I don't know him. He certainly isn't making a name for himself on the Supreme Court thus far. Seems as though if it weren't for the unsubstantiated allegation against him and the general political climate right now, nobody besides dedicated Supreme Court watchers would even know this guy's name.
Comment (114): every person who still maintains a facebook account supports this shit 100%.
Comment (115): \#FUCKFACEBOOK

Say NO to fascism, kids!
Comment (116): Facebook employees get paid well enough to enable all this toxic m crap but look the other way. Any outrage or open letters are just performance to make themselves feel less guilty about what they are a part of.
Comment (117): If you have a Facebook account you’re supporting Brett Kavanaugh
Comment (118): What did Kav do wrong? He just had some beers.
Comment (119): Lmao. The manufactured outrage just gets funnier the more desperate it gets.
Comment (120): I’m sorry why is this even an article? There was no problem when Facebook was donating to Booker or Harris. The Federalist is a right leaning organization. That’s the issue.
SUBMISSION (38): The real ‘deep state’ is about corporate power, not entrenched bureaucrats - This right-wing catchphrase supposedly describes rebellious government workers. But moneyed influencers are the real “deep state.”

Comment (1): “Deep State” conspiracy theories are projection, just like everything else coming from this admin.

They are accusing their opponents of doing what they themselves are actually doing.
Comment (2): This is absolutely it.  Money is power and big money is big power because it can buy political influence.

That can't be what the Founders intended.
Comment (3): To the GOP, anyone who has been a part of government long enough to do their job competently is part of the Deep State.
Comment (4): I dont understand if there was a Deep State, why it would be a bunch if democrats that want to raise taxes on the rich and provide healthcare. If there was some shadow government wouldn't it be a bunch of rich people that wanted to stay rich?
Comment (5): A government worker following the law is never "deep state."
Comment (6): I have so many issues with anyone who uses the term "deep state" as it reveals a good deal of ignorance on a multitude of levels.
Comment (7): Just say neoliberal capitalism.
Comment (8): Moneyed influencers and secretive intelligence agencies. Right WaPo?
Comment (9): This is truth. Think about it. Since “Citizens United” the majority of the gridlock comes from the fact that most politicians don’t want to get “primaried”, meaning that a rich person could come in an essentially get them out of the race simply by pouring their money onto a superpac for the other candidate. 

This makes the whole system vulnerable to legal extortion, and it makes it dependent on a few multimillionaires and not the regular voters. Republicans were quick to learn about this with the Tea party.

Comment (1): >Mark Sandy would be the first OMB employee to testify in the inquiry, after OMB acting director Russell T. Vought and two other political appointees at the agency defied congressional subpoenas to appear...
But unlike these other OMB officials, Sandy is a career employee, not one appointed by the president. He has worked at the agency off and on for over a decade, under presidents of both parties, climbing the ranks into his current role as deputy associate director for national security programs.



Alright Mark! Way to put **Country over Cult**!
Comment (2): This blanket refusal "absolute immunity" bullshit was a catastrophic mistake.

Mulvaney, Perry, Pompeo, Giuliani - they all could and would have walked right up to the line of perjury, with distortions and do-not-recalls and not-how-I-remembers-its, and set up the best possible defense of Trump.

Instead, the patriotic Americans who took their oaths seriously are locking down the narrative to the truth.
Comment (3): Just a reminder, here are the casualties of Nixon. He walked off into the sunset. **The people who helped him didn't.**

40 government officials indicted or jailed

H.R. Haldeman and John Erlichman (White House staff), resigned 30 April 1973, subsequently jailed

John Dean (White House legal counsel), sacked 30 April 1973, subsequently jailed

John Mitchell, Attorney-General and Chairman of the Committee to Re-elect the President (CREEP), jailed

Howard Hunt and G. Gordon Liddy (ex-White House staff), planned the Watergate break-in, both jailed

Charles Colson, special counsel to the President, jailed

James McCord (Security Director of CREEP), jailed
Comment (4): >Mark Sandy could provide insight into the process by which some $400 million in military and security aid to Ukraine was held up over the summer. He was among the career staffers who raised questions about the hold-up on the aid.  
>  
>Sandy’s signature appears on at least one of the so-called apportionment letters in July that prevented the money from going to Ukraine. But after that, the process for approving or denying such funds was taken over by a political appointee at OMB, Mike Duffey, who defied a congressional subpoena to testify earlier this month. 

Smocking gun?
Comment (5): > But unlike these other OMB officials, Sandy is a career employee, not one appointed by the president.

Trust me, it will soon be Mulvaney's time in the barrel
Comment (6): I hope this guy can truthfully say Mick ordered him to authorize the delay to put him in the untenable position of taking the fall or defending himself.
Comment (7): This is called patriotism. Hallelujah.
Comment (8): Everyone should testify. It’s the fucking  law lol
Comment (9): If I was a career Govt employee and I had info indicating Trump had broken the law I too would break rank. Being a Career Govt Employee should teach you one thing

Politicians, come and go. as Mr. Kent said in his testimony he serves the president, and he has served 3 Republican president, and 2 Democratic presidents. He understands that one day Trump will be gone, and he will still be employed.
Comment (10): Oh my God, yes! I've been waiting for someone in OMB to stand up, especially since some of the more budgetary related testimonies.
Comment (11): **OMB:**

 \*receives subpoena*

**White house:**


 \*Used Obstruction*

...

\*Was not effective*


 

**OMB:**

\*Complies with Subpoena*
Comment (12): Now we know why Trump didn't take any helicopter question time today.
Comment (13): Ahhhh this is huge.
Comment (14): I hope our nation thanks these Patriots properly when this is all said and done.
Comment (15): Oh Mama...  When the numbers people turn on you, you're in for a bad time. Trump, billionaire or not, does not have deeper pockets than the US Treasury. I fully expect the desperation to ramp up significantly. 

Hold on to your butts people.
Comment (16): This is the guy that had the authority to release the Ukrainian aid but was told not to do so by the WH. Then he was replaced by Michael Duffy, a Trump appointee who used to be the executive director of the Republican Party Wisconsin. He’s refusing a subpoena btw
Comment (17): "Break rank"? Officials serve the United States, and telling the truth to the House doing their supervisory role, when asked, is part of their job. Doing their job is not "breaking rank".
Comment (18): Follow the money.
Comment (19): In before republikidfuckers call him Deep State Sandy!
Comment (20): Uh okay, BUT WHAT ABOUT BUTTERY MALES?
Comment (21): The goalposts have been moved out of the stadium.  Where are they gonna put them next?
Comment (22): If this was 1934 Germany Trump would just have all of these people killed and probably everyone in his cabinet who knows something. I’m glad we still have laws and a legal process to follow.
Comment (23): I don't think he help up the aid for his own reasons. He did it because the White House directed it (illegally). Nothing needs to be explained except to document what and how Mulvaney communicated this to him.
Comment (24): Excellent!
Comment (25): And the hits just keep on coming! What a time to be alive!
Comment (26): Y’all don’t know what this guy is going to say yet. Everybody needs to calm down.
Comment (27): Show me the [misappropriated] money!
Comment (28): Finally!  Someone with morals!
Comment (29): Break ranks? How fucking dumb. Everyone should be participating ffs.
Comment (30): I want the Clown to see everyone around him turn against them to save their own asses.  Trump doesn't deserve any of the loyalty he demands.
Comment (31): \*undertaker gong hits\*
Comment (32): Deep State Sandy!!!
Comment (33): Is this another "star witness" who wasnt on the call and have literally never spoken to Trump?

You got him this time for sure /s
Comment (34): The continuous stream of make believe "scandals" would be funny if it weren't so serious.  Their dilutional TSD induced failures just keep coming. One false smoking gun after another for three years. AOC said it out right it's all about 2020 and they know their candidates cant win.

Comment (1): Fun fact:

When you accept a pardon, you can no longer be held accountable for the pardoned crime, so you lose you 5th amendment right to remain silent about that crime and you can be compelled to testify against your co-conspirators, or be imprisoned until you do.  Sorry, Roger.  There will be no pardons.
Comment (2): The president is in no condition to be pardoning Mueller stuff right now. You'll just have to wait this one out like Manafort's been doing :)
Comment (3): Great move...pardoning during impeachment.../s
Comment (4): I'm wondering when Alex Jones will be arrested for jury tampering.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/11/07/alex-jones-threatened-name-roger-stone-juror-experts-say-that-might-be-jury-tampering/

Thinking maybe they'll make a move after Stone's conviction, to avoid a mistrial.
Comment (5): Trump: New phone who dis
Comment (6): This headline is the kind of thing that littered my nightmares after the 2016 election.
Comment (7): Jury is already deliberating?
Comment (8): Groveling Stone.
Comment (9): I hardly know the guy says Trump.
Comment (10): Stone should check in with Manafort to see how this strategy works out.
Comment (11): This is getting better and better by the day
Comment (12): I literally cannot wait for tomorrow's Knowledge Fight episode.
Comment (13): I wonder what Alex Jones' good friend Joe Rogan thinks about him acting as an inbetween for Trump and his criminal former adviser.
Comment (14): The pardon power needs to be tweaked. Maybe just some sort of judicial review to make sure it's not being used to get your friends off the hook. If the president wants to pardon a case of some injustice that has nothing to do with him personally, fine, but if it's directly related to him like with Stone, that should be a no go.
Comment (15): I think both trump and stone forget that pardoning Nixon RUINED Fords career. He was pretty well respected before that move.
Comment (16): There's three people named in that headline who should all go fuck themselves.
Comment (17): Man this reeks of the typical bullshit conservatives spew these days. I, the criminal, am right and its the courts, arbiters of justice, who are wrong in this case. Cry me a fucking river. What are courts even for? Party of Law and Order my ass.
Comment (18): It's not going to happen Roger.

Cohen learned this.

Manafort learned this.

Trump only pardons people that have no possible evidence to his crimes.  It's why he pardoned Arpaio, and that one boxer.

You are going to die in prison, as a number.
Comment (19): "And he said to me, 'Alex, barring a miracle, I appeal to God and I appeal to your listeners for prayer, and I appeal to the president to pardon me because to do so would be an action that would show these corrupt courts that they're not going to get away with persecuting people for their free speech or for the crime of getting the president elected,'" Jones continued, adding that Stone asserted, "If we don't do that, it will embolden their criminal activity."
Comment (20): From the article;

> "Roger Stone's message is this," Jones said during Thursday's broadcast of Infowars' *The Alex Jones Show*,  "He expected to be convicted. He said, 'Only a miracle can save me now,' that was exact words to me last night and this morning." 

superlativelaughter.jpg
Comment (21): Sad it took this long for your fuckery to catch up to you. Enjoy prison.
Comment (22): Through all of the BS the last couple years, this is honestly the thing that blows my mind the most.  How many people is Trump going to publicly throw under the bus before these guys get it?  Trump cares about Trump.  That's all, nobody else, period.  He has no loyalty to ANYBODY, and he will not hesitate to throw you to the wolves just like everyone before you.  But for some reason, each new lackey seems to think they're somehow special.  How stupid can you be?
Comment (23): Given Alex Jones is relaying this it wouldn't surprise me if he and Stone never even talked and Jones is "helping" by making shit up as usual.
Comment (24): After all that cocky smiling heading into the court room and being arrested by the FBI he’s just another scared little rat when consequences are looming. Fuck this guy so hard.
Comment (25): That would be some incredibly bad optics for Trump to go pardoning the guy that sought info from WikiLeaks to help him win the 2016 election.
Comment (26): Yeah, I’m sure that’ll look good.
Comment (27): Patsy!
Comment (28): the pardon power is fucking stupid tbh
Comment (29): So Alex Jones of all people has direct access to the President?
Comment (30): "I'm super innocent and all, but damn am I going to need a pardon after this jury decides the fate that they haven't decided yet!" - Totally Innocent People
Comment (31): Trump better know better than do this. Stone deserves to rot in prison. Total comic book supervillain
Comment (32): I hate this guys face so much.
Comment (33): Roger can eat a whole bag of dicks
Comment (34): Roger Stone? I knew him a long time ago. Really, hardly ever talked to him. Maybe only once? Not even sure who he is. Maybe I’ll pardon him, I don’t know, we’ll see.
Comment (35): Is Alex Jones really the guy you want to play Telephone with to get a message to Trump? You'll end up getting "a garden for your limes."
Comment (36): Roger Stone? Look,  I meet lots of people . I might have met him once or twice but I couldn’t tell you what he looks like. If there was a room full of people I couldn’t tell you which one is roger stone. He’s not my type anyway.
Comment (37): How is Alex Jones allowed to broadcast potentially trial changing information?
Comment (38): Roger Stone's defense was "I did it" and the entire thing was designed to shield the President from any implications of the Mueller probe (which we've already all forgotten about because Barr had weeks to message the results and thus it showed "no collusion and no obstruction") and we'll probably quietly move on from this and Stone will be pardoned and the Senate won't vote the convict and Trump will call it an acquittal, and you HAVE TO KNOCK ON DOORS next year and donate and get involved and do everything you can to not let this asshole win again.
Comment (39): Trump does not give a shit about people he used and discarded.

When will his allies get that?
Comment (40):  "And he said to me, 'Alex, barring a miracle, I appeal to God and I  appeal to your listeners for prayer, and I appeal to the president to  pardon me because to do so would be an action that would show these  corrupt courts that they're not going to get away with persecuting  people for their free speech or for the crime of getting the president  elected,'" Jones continued, adding that Stone asserted, "If we don't do  that, it will embolden their criminal activity."

my god, the nerves of this guy. and the twisted reality he lives in.
Comment (41): Awwww.  Poor snowflake.  Thoughts and prayers.
Comment (42): Hey Alex... How're those kids of yours?
Comment (43): Hey my testimony accuses you of lying but could you please pardon me?

Comment (45): He's going to be so pissed, when he is convicted & sentenced, and his good friend, the POTUS, refuses to help him out.

"Roger Stone? Barely knew him..."
Comment (46): Evil rotten man. Belonged in prison 50+ years ago.
Comment (47): Give the man the fifth he asks for.  If he accepts, he is compelled to testify because he's accepted his guilt to the courts.  And that'll play *so* well with independent, undecided voters.
Comment (48): So he will be admitting his guilt?  Hmm...
Comment (49): Stone could serve a lesser sentence as he is a non-violent first time offender.

Stone could serve a lesser sentence as he is rich and white.

Fixed that for you.
Comment (50): Solid plan, Alex Jones is a credible and very stable man
Comment (51): Assuming this is true, isn't this an admission of guilt?
Comment (52): If the impeachment goes south for Trump or if he does not get re-elected, all of these people are going to get pardons.
Comment (53): Too bad they couldn't delay sentencing till after trumps impeachment.
Comment (54): I will shit my pants laughing if he pardons Roger during his own impeachment proceeding
Comment (55): Seriously ? No on the pardon, but how about Club Fed ? Just a little bit....
I’m not sorry that this guy got over on Team Trump, just hope he got well paid for the non existent opposition research. I think he tried to pull some sort of PONZI scheme and it didn’t work out. The whole operation just seems so far fetched...
Comment (56): If that fucker gets pardoned, there better be a fucking riot.
Comment (57): Oh he will get a pardon
Comment (58): Wow, they're already in jury deliberation? We really didn't get to see very much of that trial
Comment (59): Headline works just as well with some juxtaposition:

*ALEX JONES REPORTEDLY PLEADS TO TRUMP THROUGH ROGER STONE AS JURY DELIBERATES HIS FATE: PLEASE ‘PARDON ME’*

‘Cause isn’t Alex in the same boat, trial-wise? He seems better suited to play the groveling crybaby role when he’s not on camera.
Comment (60): This whole administration and GOP party is so incredibly corrupt. The party of family values is all pieces of shit
Comment (61): Hahaha. Do it Trump. Pardon this dip shit and sign your death warrant.
Comment (62): > "And he said to me, 'Alex, barring a miracle, I appeal to God and I appeal to your listeners for prayer, and I appeal to the president to pardon me because to do so would be an action that would show these corrupt courts that they're not going to get away with persecuting people for their free speech or for the crime of getting the president elected,'" Jones continued, adding that Stone asserted, "If we don't do that, it will embolden their criminal activity." 

Pretty much guarantee that Stone never, ever said anything remotely like this. He probably never even communicated with Jones. It's just Alex Jones making shit up (again) trying to sound like he one of the "in crowd".

You know that annoying kid you knew growing up who would tell completely implausible lies to try to impress people, but mostly just came off as pathetic.

Alex Jones is what they grow up to be (if simply aging can be called growing up).
Comment (63): Pardons connected to impeachments are invalid under US Law.
Comment (64): I will buy reddit drinks if stone goes to jail.
Comment (65): Is this real?
Comment (66): Trump can just set him free without a full pardon. Issue clemency right?  Let the verdict stand and get Stone out with little backlash.  Say its because of health reasons.  T

Comment (1): *Blocks people from testifying*

"You have no first hand accounts!!"

No fucking shit, sherlock. Only your cult is stupid enough not to fucking understand this.
Comment (2): Yes Please
Comment (3): Finally, language Americans actually use.

&#x200B;

The problem with Pelosi and Schiff is they don't tailor their speech to their audience.  There is nothing wrong with being educated and articulate, but it isn't how you connect with an audience that isn't educated and articulate.
Comment (4): In the same clip, one person said the hearing "Devolved into nonsensical bickering about irrelevant facts."

Truly encapsulates the Republican strategy.
Comment (5): don't understand why Congress doesn't fucking do something about those who are ignoring their subpoenas. Have them arrested goddammit

Comment (1): If true, that's WORSE, because he just appoints FINANCIAL DONORS and doesn't look into ANYTHING else.
Comment (2): I don't understand why he believes that is relevant at all.

How well he knows a person who is presenting evidence of his wrongdoing is relevant how?
Comment (3): The guy he talked to on the cell phone with multiple witnesses in Ukraine?
Comment (4): Just a coffee donor
Comment (5): I mean...do I KNOW know him.  Not like that.
Comment (6): Trumps defense is that he is so corrupt he allows people he doesn’t know to buy their way into ambassadorships. 

Slick
Comment (7): "Facing evidence, Trump lies" covers most cases.
Comment (8): *Teacher asks about kid with tongue frozen to metal pole...*

Flick? Flick who?
Comment (9): He doesn't even know who's in all the mirrors he looks at. 

*"They look like me but all his features are on the wrong sides; I call him Pmurt or Mert."*
Comment (10): What a piece of s*** this president is
Comment (11): And? You still appointed him. Not knowing the guy you appointed makes the whole situation worse, if that possibility still exists.
Comment (12): Hey Republicans! Remember when we asked Trump about the Stormy Daniel check on Air Force One and he said he had no idea about it?

You think he’s lying about this one too? :)
Comment (13): Who would have guessed he would say that?  I can't wait until he tries to say he doesn't know Guiliani.    https://image.businessinsider.com/5af17eb319ee8618008b49ac?width=1300&format=jpeg&auto=webp
Comment (14): No impeachment necessary, Trump should just be removed from office for his inability to “remember” anything. Isn’t having a memory a qualifying factor to run a country?
Comment (15): What an absolute failure, everyone knows [the proper defense](https://youtu.be/YGYroufxtfQ?t=4) to circumstances like these. The Mariah Carey defense is less reliable.
Comment (16): Just another weird case of "[**Never Knew the Guy!**](https://www.snopes.com/tachyon/2019/07/trump-epstein-wide.jpg?resize=865,452)"
Comment (17): Alzheimer's confirmed. Same thing happened with my grandma, one day she just stopped knowing her friends and associates.
Comment (18): [Don Siegelman spent 6 years in federal prison for the same charge, and it wasn't even a legitimate case... his real crime was making an early enemy of Karl Rove.](https://whnt.com/2018/02/16/former-alabama-governor-don-siegelman-talks-about-prison-his-life-his-future-and-his-new-passion/)

Incidentally, this is the really disturbing thing about "Lock her up" chants. The Republicans DO frame their enemies. It's happened before.
Comment (19): Donald Trump Junior? Never heard of him.

Comment (1): Too many big words for Trump voters, let's simplify it.

"They're lying sacks of crap"
Comment (2): *But for curious behavior, Republicans have them easily beat, and their conduct during the impeachment inquiry is the culmination and apotheosis of their conduct since Trump wrapped up the Republican presidential nomination: **an utter sellout of principle and a pure embrace of fiction to pacify an emotional infant and keep him from spitting up on them.***
Comment (3): Long way to say Traitors to their own country
Comment (4): > Trump’s an autocrat all right, but the silver lining is that he’s an inept one. 

Honestly, when I'm overly stressed about some dumbshit thing he is doing, this does give me some solace.
Comment (5): The Party of It's Okay When We Do It.
Comment (6): When Adam Savage said “I reject your reality and substitute my own”, he was quoting a movie, not giving you guys ideas!
Comment (7): For 60 year old guys they certainly are flexible enough to suck their own dicks
Comment (8): "mental limberness" - "ethical elasticity"

That's like saying Hitler was impolite toward Jews.
Comment (9): Ethical *inelasticity*. Elastic things retain their shape. Inelastic things deform and get more and more fucked up with no signs of returning to normal.
Comment (10): Looks like GOP are sending their own Comical Ali now.
Comment (11): ethical elasticity. i like it. 

hey devon great job with your ethical elasticity!
Comment (12): You are either ethical or you are not. It isn't a rubber band.
Comment (13): We’ve been given a Banana Republic, if we can keep it. - GOP

Comment (1): You can hear the goal posts constantly being moved.
Comment (2): What the fuck is attempted bribery?
If a cop arrests someone for offering a bribe, is that a lesser crime than if he accepted it? It's the same thing, bribery. What the fuck..
Comment (3): Attempted Bribery is Bribery.  You don't need to deliver on the bribe, just offering is enough.  The scheme doesn't need to payoff.

"The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, **Bribery**, or other High crimes and Misdemeanors."
Comment (4): Murder isn’t in the Constitution either.

I guess Trump really *could* shoot someone in broad daylight!   /s
Comment (5): Bribery is the PROPOSITION. Nothing more. No bribe needs to be accepted to be an illegal act.
Comment (6): "No no, officer! You didn't take me up on my offer to suck your dick to get out of a ticket, therefore you can't arrest me!"
Comment (7): Incase anyone is unsure, the crime is offering the bribe.  Whether or not the bribe is accepted or not does not change the fact them at the crime  was already committed committed.  As such, there is no such thing as “attempted bribery” either a bribe was offered or it was not. If it was then the crime of bribery was committed. If it was successful then the one being bribed would be guilty of a different crime, accepting a bribe.
Comment (8): Well it doesn't say attempted bribery.... 

Wow.
Comment (9): Ingraham is full of crap. Anyone with a brain can understand the idiocy of her statement.
Comment (10): The goal on the part of the GOP propaganda machine is not to Get the truth or accuracy but rather to sew confusion and doubt. Misinformation and lies once out in the world may be fact checked but the correction doesn't reach everyone. So they just turn on the fire hose and blast lies and misinformation and keep the GOPs base placated which is the only thing that matters to them.
Comment (11): It still boggles the mind that her behavior (purposefully misleading the public on the law) is not grounds for disbarment for violation of professional ethics, because what she is doing is technically classified as "entertainment".
Comment (12): Another garbage person, Nikki Haley is pushing this same talking point as well.
Comment (13): I’m not guilty of robbing this bank because the teller called my finger-gun-in-pocket bluff and didn’t give me the money. I did nothing wrong!
Comment (14): Worst "defense" ever
Comment (15): I wonder if her brother will have something to say about this.
Comment (16): They better raid the McDonald's for extra straws to grasp at
Comment (17): The "stop" sign didn't say "no murder"...

Plus, we didn't even kill the guy. He lived.

Totally exonerates the President. ^/s
Comment (18): Yet another frothing unhinged right wing loon
Comment (19): Well, it is clearly in the criminal code.    18 U.S.C. § 201(b)  
          
And, yes, it sounds like bribery to me.
Comment (20): Is there any question whatsoever that we Americans feel that our President should not attempt to bribe, be bribed or extort foreign leaders? Even if it is legal (it's not), why the fuck are they going to a place where we are accepting that it's permissible behavior now or in the future? 

What Trump did is clear and becoming more clear, which leads to the terrifying thing: this is all going to come down to "was it OK for Trump to extort or not?". If the Right wins, then guess what country we live in going forward?

Comment (1): Nothing says “fascism and prostitution” like TRUMP.
Comment (2): For when you want your emolument to have a happy ending.
Comment (3): All these trade tariffs are probably used as a weapon for trump to create more self profit.
Comment (4): Trump is helping the worldwide sex trafficking trade for more reasons than his own personal pleasure...

Profits. 

How many kids did they lose at the border? How many (just popped up out of nowhere privatized prison) shelters appeared to handle all these kids?
How many did they lose?
How many did they 'not' lose?
Comment (5): "massage parlours"; "concierge services". 

Why not get Paula White as CEO of this operation? Ya know, "fishies for God" and that kind of thing.
Comment (6): >If no one objects, they will be formally registered after 90 days.

Well, my my my...
Comment (7): This guy is simply unbelievable and his followers are still licking his boots
Comment (8): People bitching about Hunter Biden profiting from his dad's name seem to be A-OK with this. 

Because they're morons.
Comment (9): and they greenlit this just out of admiration for the orange idiot?
Comment (10): The real reason for the trade war?

Comment (19): “DIBS” - Robert Kraft
Comment (20): apparently china is not as angry about the tariffs as they claim.
Comment (21): I always have to question if this is real life. *this has to satire* no it’s NEWS
Comment (22): Fuck Donald Trump and all his cult members
Comment (23): The man is disgusting in his greed.
Comment (24): Is this the job creation by Ivanka that Trump Senior was referring to? She would do well as a Madam, what with the complete lack of empathy and moral fiber.
Comment (25): How much does the grab ‘em by the pussy full service massage go for?
Comment (26): The President of the United States is a pimp. Wow!

Comment (1): What a piece of s*** this president is
Comment (2): I’ve been wondering why they aren’t just calling this quid-pro-quo thing “extortion,” but I guess “bribery” works too
Comment (3): * **Bribery**
* **Extortion**
* **Abuse of Power**
* **Threat to National Security**
Comment (4): Bribery is an impeachable offence like sending a poop emoji is an impeachable offence.

It's not a criminal trial- you don't need to be guilty of a crime to be impeached.

Although it sure helps, and bribery is a doozie.
Comment (5): Is there just a wheel that Democrats spin once a week to come up with a new attack on The President?

Comment (1): Nothing like adding an article of impeachment in real time during an impeachment hearing.
Comment (2): Trump continues to make himself look *more* guilty.
Comment (3): Tweets about her during her testimony but he 'hasn't watched one minute' of the proceedings.
Comment (4): At this point we should have him do the questioning in court. 😉
Comment (5): Trump's syphilis ravaged mind is actively betraying him...
Comment (6): He's such an idiot.
Comment (7): Wow. If there were no real life 'evil villains,' Donald mother fucking Trump has effectively made them a reality. A sad parody of one, of course.
Comment (8): President Big Brain.
Comment (9): “Me so smrt”
Comment (10): Look at Nunes in that photograph with Schiff. Am I being hopeful here, or are his eyes and hand-to-face revealing just how deeply fucked he knows himself to be.

Comment (1): > In an interview with The Guardian, the former New York mayor was asked whether he was nervous should the president decide to throw him under the bus.
> 
> The House of Representatives is probing claims Trump abused his office in waging a pressure campaign, in which Giuliani played a key role, for Ukraine to announce a probe into Joe Biden. 
> 
> **"I'm not, but I do have very, very good insurance, so if he does, all my hospital bills will be paid," remarked Giuliani.** 
> 
> **At this point in the call Giuliani's own attorney, Robert Costello, interjected to say: "He's joking."**
> 
> The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Comment (2): I really wish the audio for that interview were available. Things get taken so literally these days and as humorous  as it is to have the idiot’s own lawyer blackmailing him, it would be a bummer if it was just Guiliani’s attempt at a joke. 

If not, I’m hoping Giuliani is Epstein’s dead man’s switch.
Comment (3): Of course he does. Giuliani was a prosecutor in New York during the years that Trump was running around town doing whatever he wanted to because he was Fred Trump's kid. 

Comforting to think that at least one person has knowledge of criminal acts that our President* has committed. /s

 Makes you long for the days when a prior divorce was a disqualifier for a Presidential campaign. These days, apparently, we are okay with actual criminals running for and winning the office.
Comment (4): You know who else was rumored to have had "insurance?"  Epstein.  

If I were Rudy, I'd be a bit nervous.
Comment (5): Everyone got compromising evidence on this president. There’s so many hands on those tiny balls that there just isn’t enough space.
Comment (6): Yay mafia government.
Comment (7): Like Trump's little reminders he sends out to his people, Giuliani is sending a message to Trump, he doesn't want Trump to use him as a scapegoat because he has dirt on him, the insurance, that Trump is afraid to have known, and if Trump turns on him.....well we would have a show
Comment (8): I hope his insurance has a when-I-die-it-will-be-splashed-all-over-the-internet clause, otherwise he's likely to be epsteined
Comment (9): When (not if, when) Trump and Giuliani start their own war against each other the world will be struggling to produce enough popcorn for us viewers
Comment (10): Rudy: "I have blackmail, everybody! Blackmail, getchyer blackmail here!!”
Comment (11): "Does HE have the nude pics?! ...And can I see them?"

-Devin Nunes, probably.
Comment (12): I have figured he would be the largest idiot known if he did not have audio proof of Trump telling him what to do.

Look at past Republican criminal conspiracy. They always shuffle all the blame on the idiots.
Comment (13): So now Rudy has kompromat on Trump too?  Who doesn't have kompromat on this guy?
Comment (14): You just *know* these guys are all going to end up eating each other.

And it's going to be *epic.*
Comment (15): I'd like to see how that works :)
Comment (16): Can we acknowledge that the fact we're having this discussion at all is fucking absurd in the highest degree?

Our president has a personal lawyer that operates as his fixer in both personal and state matters, but with no oversight from the state, and said lawyer is publicly waving apparent blackmail insurance against the president in case he turns on him... but we've done nothing wrong! Nothing to see here!
Comment (17): Wow he's dumb. You really think bragging about extorting the president isn't going to attract the attention of our intelligence community, and possibly the FBI?
Comment (18): He’s got dirt that could destroy Trump and he’s still defending Trump? How does that make any sense?
Comment (19): Rudy says a lot of things, most of it is complete garbage.
Comment (20): Trump probably won't need to throw him under the bus.  Giuliani is already under three separate investigations.  He's probably going to jail on his own merit.
Comment (21): It's almost as if assembling a group of people who have no sense of loyalty whatsoever is an ineffective way to try to pull off a criminal conspiracy.
Comment (22): So he has evidence that he is withholding? That’s great Rudy Radio we’ll get from you soon.
Comment (23): Rudy has seen, one by one, the President cast away his rubes when their number gets called. He is threatening Trump here. "Dont dump me Donny, I've watched your shitflower blossom for decades." 

Trapped rats with nothing to eat but themselves.

Comment (1): > In her time in Kyiv, Ambassador Yovanovitch was tough on corruption, too tough on corruption for some, and her principled stance made her enemies.  As George Kent told this committee on Wednesday, “you can't promote principled anti-corruption action without pissing-off corrupt people.”
> 
> **And Ambassador Yovanovitch did not just “piss off” corrupt Ukrainians, like the corrupt former prosecutor general Yuri Lutsenko, but also certain Americans like Rudy Giuliani**, Donald Trump’s personal attorney, and two individuals, now indicted, who worked with him, Igor Fruman and Lev Parnas.  Lutsenko, Giuliani, Fruman, Parnas and others who would come to include the president’s own son, Don Jr., promoted a smear campaign against her based on false allegations. At the State Department there was an effort to push back, to obtain a statement of support from Secretary Pompeo, but those efforts failed, when it became clear that President Trump wanted her gone.
> 
>
>Some have argued, that a president has the ability to nominate or remove any ambassador he wants, that they serve at the pleasure of the president. And that is true. The question before us is not whether Donald Trump could recall an American ambassador with a stellar reputation for fighting corruption in Ukraine, but why would he want to? Why did Rudy Giuliani want her gone, and why did Donald Trump? And why would Donald Trump instruct the new team he put in place, the three Amigos – Gordon Sondland, Rick Perry and Kurt Volker -- to work with the same man, Rudy Giuliani, who played such a central role in the smear campaign against her?

>...

> One powerful ally Giuliani had in Ukraine to promote these political investigations was Lutsenko, the corrupt former prosecutor general.  And one powerful adversary Lutsenko had was a certain U.S. Ambassador named Marie Yovanovitch. It is no coincidence that in the now infamous July 25th call with Zelensky, Donald Trump brings up a corrupt Ukrainian prosecutor and praises him. Against all evidence, Trump claims that this former prosecutor general was “very good” and “he was shut down and that's really unfair.” But the woman known for fighting corruption, his own former Ambassador, the woman ruthlessly smeared and driven from her post, the president does nothing but disparage. Or worse, threaten. “Well, she’s going to go through some things,” the President declares. That tells you a lot about the President’s priorities and intentions.

Yovanovitch's testimony will highlight Giuliani's smear campaign. Meanwhile, [the SDNY is looking into Giuliani and friends' scheme to get rid of Yovanovitch.](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/impeachment-inquiry-public-federal-prosecutors-quietly-investigate-giuliani/story?id=66898545)

Comment (3): Is there a megathread on today's proceedings?
Comment (4): I'm watching this is real time today. Schiff is not taking any republican bullshit tactics in today's hearing. It's a thing of beauty. I also enjoyed him calling out the President for tweeting out witness intimidation after her opening statement.
